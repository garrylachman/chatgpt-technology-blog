## Introduction
Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear and concise code. Let's dive into Python programming with some basic examples.

## Variables and Data Types
```python
# Declare and initialize variables
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
is_student = True
weight = 70.5

# Print variables
print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")
print("Am I a student?", is_student)
print("My weight is", weight)
```
Output:
```
My name is John Doe
I am 25 years old
Am I a student? True
My weight is 70.5
```

## Control Flow
```python
# If-else statement
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative number")
else:
    print("Zero")

# For loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)

# While loop
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
Output:
```
Positive number
1
2
3
4
5
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Functions
```python
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

# Function call
greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```
Output:
```
Hello, Alice
Hello, Bob
```

## Lists and Tuples
```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Print the first item
print(fruits[0])

# Add an item to the list
fruits.append("orange")

# Print all items
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Tuple
person = ("John", 25, "USA")

# Print the second item
print(person[1])
```
Output:
```
apple
apple
banana
cherry
orange
25
```

## Dictionaries
```python
# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

# Access values using keys
print(student["name"])
print(student["age"])

# Update values
student["age"] = 21

# Print all key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key + ":", value)
```
Output:
```
Alice
20
name: Alice
age: 21
grade: A
```

## File Handling
```python
# Read a file
file = open("sample.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()

# Write to a file
file = open("output.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, World!")
file.close()
```

## Object-Oriented Programming
```python
# Class definition
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.1415 * self.radius ** 2

# Object creation and method call
circle = Circle(5)
print("Area:", circle.area())
```
Output:
```
Area: 78.53750000000001
```
