# Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for various purposes such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an ideal language for beginners to start their programming journey. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Python programming and explore its core concepts.

## Setting up the Development Environment

Before we begin programming in Python, we need to set up our development environment. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

1. Download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to choose the latest version compatible with your operating system.

2. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your Python code. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Atom.

3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

```shell
python --version
```

If the command returns the installed Python version, you are ready to proceed.

## Hello, World!

In any programming language, the first program we write is typically the "Hello, World!" program. It is a simple program that prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's the Python code for it:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the above code in a file with a `.py` extension, such as `hello_world.py`. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is located, and run the following command:

```shell
python hello_world.py
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed to the console.

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in our programs. Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more. Here's an example that demonstrates declaring variables and their data types:

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
height = 1.75

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_student = True
```

By assigning values to variables, we can perform operations and manipulate the data as needed.

## Control Structures

Control structures in Python allow us to control the flow of our programs based on certain conditions. The most common control structures are `if` statements and loops.

### If Statements

The `if` statement is used to check if a certain condition is true and execute a block of code accordingly. Here's an example:

```python
age = 25

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult yet.")
```

### Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports two types of loops: `for` and `while`.

The `for` loop iterates over a sequence, such as a list or a string. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. Here's an example:

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of Python programming, including setting up the development environment, writing the "Hello, World!" program, working with variables and data types, and using control structures. Python offers a wide range of possibilities, and this tutorial serves as a starting point for your programming journey. Happy coding!
