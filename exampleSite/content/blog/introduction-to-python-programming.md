# Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. In this tutorial, we will explore the basics of Python programming and learn about its syntax, data types, control flow, and functions.

## Installing Python

First, you need to install Python on your machine. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once installed, open the command prompt or terminal and type the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:

```shell
python --version
```

If you see the version number, you are good to go!

## Your First Python Program

Let's start with a classic "Hello, World!" program. Create a new file called `hello_world.py` and add the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and open the command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_world.py` and type the following command to run the program:

```shell
python hello_world.py
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have successfully run your first Python program.

## Variables and Data Types

Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Let's declare a few variables and explore different data types in Python:

```python
# Integer
x = 10

# Floating-point number
y = 3.14

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_active = True
```

In Python, you can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable. Let's print the data types of our variables:

```python
print(type(x))            # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))            # <class 'float'>
print(type(name))         # <class 'str'>
print(type(is_active))    # <class 'bool'>
```

## Control Flow Statements

Python provides several control flow statements, such as if-else, for loop, and while loop. Let's explore these statements with code examples:

### if-else Statement

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")
```

### for Loop

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### while Loop

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. In Python, you can define functions using the `def` keyword. Here's an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)    # 5
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the basics of Python programming. You have learned how to install Python, write your first program, work with variables and data types, use control flow statements, and define functions. Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a powerful language for various applications. Keep exploring and building with Python!
