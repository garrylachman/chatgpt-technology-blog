## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a responsive website using HTML and CSS. Responsive design ensures that the website adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. If you are new to web development, I recommend completing introductory tutorials on HTML and CSS first.

## Getting Started

Let's start by creating the basic structure of our HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Responsive Website</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My Responsive Website</h1>
  </header>
  
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  </section>
  
  <footer>
    <p>Â© 2022 My Responsive Website. All rights reserved.</p>
  </footer>
  
</body>
</html>
```

In the above code, we have defined the basic structure of our website using HTML tags such as `html`, `head`, `title`, `meta`, `body`, `header`, `nav`, `ul`, `li`, `a`, `section`, and `footer`. We have also linked an external CSS file called `styles.css`.

## Styling the Website with CSS

Now, let's create the `styles.css` file and add CSS rules to style our website.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
}

nav {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  padding: 10px;
}

nav ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

nav ul li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

nav ul li a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #333;
}

section {
  padding: 20px;
}

footer {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  color: #333;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

The above CSS code defines styles for `body`, `header`, `nav`, `ul`, `li`, `a`, `section`, and `footer` elements. We have provided some sample styles, but feel free to customize them according to your preferences.

## Making the Website Responsive

To make our website responsive, we need to add some CSS media queries. Media queries allow us to apply different styles based on the device's screen size.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  header {
    text-align: center;
  }
  
  nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  
  nav ul li {
    display: block;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
  }
}
```

In the above code, we have defined media queries for screens with a maximum width of 600 pixels. Inside the media queries, we have updated the styles for the `header`, `nav`, and `nav ul li` elements to make them center-aligned and stack vertically.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a responsive website using HTML and CSS. By applying responsive design principles and using CSS media queries, your website will now provide a great user experience across different devices.

Feel free to experiment with different styles and layouts to further enhance your website. Happy coding!
