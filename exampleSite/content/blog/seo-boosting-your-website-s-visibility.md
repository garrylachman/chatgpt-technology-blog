Search engine optimization is the practice of optimizing your website and its content to make it more visible to search engines like Google.

2. Content: Creating high-quality, informative, and original content that resonates with your audience.
3. On-Page Optimization: Optimizing meta tags, headings, URLs, and other on-page elements to make them more search engine-friendly.
4. Off-Page Optimization: Building high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites to improve your website's credibility and authority.
5. User Experience: Ensuring your website is easy to navigate, loads quickly, and is mobile-friendly.
