# Beginner's Guide to Python Programming

In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of Python programming. Python is a popular and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Whether you are a beginner or have prior programming experience, this guide will help you get started with Python.

## Setting Up Python

Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.

To check if Python is successfully installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the version number of Python you have installed.

## Hello, World!

Let's start by writing a simple "Hello, World!" program. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called `hello.py`. In this file, enter the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and navigate to the directory where you saved it using the terminal or command prompt. To run the program, type:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` displayed in the terminal.

## Variables and Data Types

Python is dynamically-typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare variable types. Let's explore this concept with some examples. Create a new file called `variables.py` and enter the following code:

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
pi = 3.14

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_student = True

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Pi:", pi)
print("Is Student?", is_student)
```

Save the file and run it using the same command as before:

```bash
python variables.py
```

You should see the values of the variables printed in the terminal.

## Control Flow

Python provides several control flow statements to control the flow of your program. Let's explore a few of them. Create a new file called `control_flow.py` and enter the following code:

```python
# if statement
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative number")
else:
    print("Zero")

# for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# while loop
count = 5

while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
```

Save the file and run it:

```bash
python control_flow.py
```

You should see the corresponding outputs based on the condition and loop iterations.

## Functions

Functions allow you to break down your code into reusable blocks. Let's create a simple function that calculates the square of a number. Create a new file called `functions.py` and enter the following code:

```python
def square(num):
    return num ** 2

result = square(4)
print("Square of 4:", result)
```

Save the file and run it:

```bash
python functions.py
```

You should see the output `Square of 4: 16` displayed in the terminal.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned the basics of Python programming. This tutorial covered setting up Python, writing your first program, working with variables and data types, control flow statements, and functions.

Python is a versatile language with a wide range of applications. With this foundation, you can explore more advanced topics and build exciting projects. Happy coding!

Remember to save and execute your Python files with the `.py` extension using the `python` command followed by the filename.

Keep practicing and experimenting with Python to enhance your programming skills. Happy coding!
