# Creating a Simple Calculator in Python

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a basic calculator using Python. We will use simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Step 1: Getting Started

First, let's create a new Python file and name it `calculator.py`. Open the file in your preferred text editor or IDE and let's begin.

## Step 2: Creating the Calculator Class

In Python, we can use classes to define objects and their behaviors. Start by creating a `Calculator` class:

```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

In the `__init__` method, we will initialize any necessary variables.

## Step 3: Adding Addition Functionality

Let's add a function to perform addition. Add the following method to the `Calculator` class:

```python
def add(self, num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

The `add` method takes in two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and returns their sum.

## Step 4: Implementing Subtraction

Similarly, let's implement subtraction functionality. Add the following method to the `Calculator` class:

```python
def subtract(self, num1, num2):
    return num1 - num2
```

The `subtract` method takes in two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and returns their difference.

## Step 5: Adding Multiplication

Next, let's add multiplication functionality. Add the following method to the `Calculator` class:

```python
def multiply(self, num1, num2):
    return num1 * num2
```

The `multiply` method takes in two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and returns their product.

## Step 6: Implementing Division

Lastly, let's implement division functionality. Add the following method to the `Calculator` class:

```python
def divide(self, num1, num2):
    if num2 == 0:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"
    return num1 / num2
```

The `divide` method takes in two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and checks if the divisor (`num2`) is zero. If it is, the method returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns the quotient of the division.

## Step 7: Testing the Calculator

Now that we have implemented all the necessary functionality, let's test our calculator. Add the following code at the end of the `calculator.py` file:

```python
# Create an instance of the Calculator class
calculator = Calculator()

# Test addition
print(calculator.add(5, 3))

# Test subtraction
print(calculator.subtract(5, 3))

# Test multiplication
print(calculator.multiply(5, 3))

# Test division
print(calculator.divide(5, 3))
```

Save the file and run it. You should see the following output:

```
8
2
15
1.6666666666666667
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a simple calculator in Python.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a basic calculator using Python. We implemented addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities. You can expand on this project by adding more operations or improving the user interface.

I hope you found this tutorial helpful. Happy coding!
