# Exploring Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They provide a structured approach to solving design and architectural challenges in software development. In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns and their implementation in Python.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when you want to limit the number of instances of a class and have centralized control over its creation.

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Usage
instance1 = Singleton()
instance2 = Singleton()

print(instance1 == instance2)  # Output: True
```

### Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It is useful when you want to delegate object creation to derived classes.

```python
class Car:
    def drive(self):
        pass

class Sedan(Car):
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving a Sedan")

class SUV(Car):
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving an SUV")

class CarFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_car(car_type):
        if car_type == "sedan":
            return Sedan()
        elif car_type == "suv":
            return SUV()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid car type")

# Usage
car_factory = CarFactory()
sedan = car_factory.create_car("sedan")
suv = car_factory.create_car("suv")

sedan.drive()  # Output: Driving a Sedan
suv.drive()  # Output: Driving an SUV
```

## Structural Patterns

### Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

```python
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteComponent(Component):
    def operation(self):
        print("Performing operation")

class Decorator(Component):
    def __init__(self, component):
        self.component = component

    def operation(self):
        self.component.operation()

class ConcreteDecorator(Decorator):
    def operation(self):
        super().operation()
        self.additional_operation()

    def additional_operation(self):
        print("Performing additional operation")

# Usage
component = ConcreteComponent()
decorated_component = ConcreteDecorator(component)
decorated_component.operation()
# Output:
# Performing operation
# Performing additional operation
```

### Proxy Pattern

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can be used to add an extra level of indirection or provide access control to the underlying object.

```python
class Subject:
    def request(self):
        pass

class RealSubject(Subject):
    def request(self):
        print("RealSubject: Handling request")

class Proxy(Subject):
    def __init__(self, real_subject):
        self.real_subject = real_subject

    def request(self):
        print("Proxy: Logging before request")
        self.real_subject.request()
        print("Proxy: Logging after request")

# Usage
real_subject = RealSubject()
proxy = Proxy(real_subject)
proxy.request()
# Output:
# Proxy: Logging before request
# RealSubject: Handling request
# Proxy: Logging after request
```

## Behavioral Patterns

### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a subject notifies its observers of any state changes. It is useful when you want to ensure loose coupling between objects.

```python
class Observer:
    def update(self, data):
        pass

class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = []

    def attach(self, observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer):
        self.observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self, data):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.update(data)

class ConcreteObserver(Observer):
    def update(self, data):
        print("Received data:", data)

# Usage
subject = Subject()
observer1 = ConcreteObserver()
observer2 = ConcreteObserver()

subject.attach(observer1)
subject.attach(observer2)

subject.notify("Hello World")
# Output:
# Received data: Hello World
# Received data: Hello World
```

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern encapsulates interchangeable algorithms and allows the client to choose the algorithm at runtime. It enables the selection and configuration of a family of algorithms independently from the clients that use them.

```python
class Strategy:
    def perform_operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
    def perform_operation(self):
        print("Performing operation A")

class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):
    def perform_operation(self):
        print("Performing operation B")

class Context:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def execute_strategy(self):
        self.strategy.perform_operation()

# Usage
strategy_a = ConcreteStrategyA()
context = Context(strategy_a)
context.execute_strategy()
# Output: Performing operation A

strategy_b = ConcreteStrategyB()
context = Context(strategy_b)
context.execute_strategy()
# Output: Performing operation B
```

These are just a few examples of design patterns in Python. Design patterns help in creating robust and flexible software architectures. By studying and implementing these patterns, you can enhance your programming skills and improve the quality of your code.
