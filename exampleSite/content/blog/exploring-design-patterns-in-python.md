# Exploring Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are an essential aspect of software development as they provide proven solutions to common problems. In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns and their implementation in Python. 

## Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to limit the number of instances of a class.

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
    
# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # Output: True
```

## Factory Pattern
The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects. It encapsulates the object creation logic and allows the client code to create objects without knowing the specific class implementation.

```python
class Product:
    def create(self) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError
    
class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def create(self) -> None:
        print("Creating ConcreteProduct1")
        
class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def create(self) -> None:
        print("Creating ConcreteProduct2")
        
class ProductFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_product(product_type: str) -> Product:
        if product_type == "product1":
            return ConcreteProduct1()
        elif product_type == "product2":
            return ConcreteProduct2()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid product type")

# Usage
factory = ProductFactory()
product1 = factory.create_product("product1")
product1.create()  # Output: Creating ConcreteProduct1

product2 = factory.create_product("product2")
product2.create()  # Output: Creating ConcreteProduct2
```

## Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, in which changes to one object trigger updates to all dependent objects. This pattern is useful when you want to decouple the subject and observer objects.

```python
class Observer:
    def update(self, subject) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError
    
class Subject:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._observers = []
        
    def attach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        self._observers.append(observer)
        
    def detach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        self._observers.remove(observer)
        
    def notify(self) -> None:
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(self)

# Usage
class ConcreteObserver(Observer):
    def update(self, subject) -> None:
        print(f"Received update from subject: {subject}")

subject = Subject()
observer = ConcreteObserver()

subject.attach(observer)
subject.notify()  # Output: Received update from subject: <__main__.Subject object at 0x7f26255d1af0>

subject.detach(observer)
subject.notify()  # No output
```

These are just a few examples of design patterns that can be used in Python. By utilizing design patterns, you can enhance the structure, readability, and maintainability of your code, making it easier to collaborate with other developers and adapt to changing requirements.

In conclusion, understanding and implementing design patterns in your Python projects can significantly contribute to the overall quality and effectiveness of your software development process. Take advantage of the power of design patterns and see your codebase thrive.
