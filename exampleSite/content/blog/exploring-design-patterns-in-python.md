# Exploring Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design and development. They provide a structured approach for solving specific design problems and promote code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.

In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns and demonstrate their implementation in Python. Let's dive in!

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the program's execution. Here's an example:

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # Output: True
```

In the above code, the `Singleton` class has a private class attribute `_instance` and a `__new__` method that checks if the instance exists. If it doesn't, it creates a new instance; otherwise, it returns the existing one.

## 2. Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern allows adding new behavior to an object dynamically without changing its class. It enhances the functionality of an object by wrapping it with one or more decorators. Consider the following example:

```python
class Component:
    def operation(self) -> str:
        pass

class ConcreteComponent(Component):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "ConcreteComponent"

class Decorator(Component):
    _component: Component = None

    def __init__(self, component: Component) -> None:
        self._component = component

    def operation(self) -> str:
        return self._component.operation()

class ConcreteDecoratorA(Decorator):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return f"ConcreteDecoratorA({self._component.operation()})"

class ConcreteDecoratorB(Decorator):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return f"ConcreteDecoratorB({self._component.operation()})"

# Usage
component = ConcreteComponent()
decoratorA = ConcreteDecoratorA(component)
decoratorB = ConcreteDecoratorB(decoratorA)

print(decoratorB.operation())  # Output: ConcreteDecoratorB(ConcreteDecoratorA(ConcreteComponent))
```

In the above code, the `Component` defines the interface for objects, the `ConcreteComponent` provides the base implementation, and the `Decorator` adds extra functionality. The `ConcreteDecoratorA` and `ConcreteDecoratorB` inherit from the `Decorator` and modify the behavior by adding their own operations.

## 3. Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Here's an example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Product(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self) -> str:
        pass

class ConcreteProductA(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "ConcreteProductA"

class ConcreteProductB(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "ConcreteProductB"

class Creator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        pass

    def some_operation(self) -> str:
        product = self.factory_method()
        return f"Creator: {product.operation()}"

class ConcreteCreatorA(Creator):
    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProductA()

class ConcreteCreatorB(Creator):
    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProductB()

# Usage
creatorA = ConcreteCreatorA()
creatorB = ConcreteCreatorB()

print(creatorA.some_operation())  # Output: "Creator: ConcreteProductA"
print(creatorB.some_operation())  # Output: "Creator: ConcreteProductB"
```

The `Product` interface defines the operations that concrete products must implement. The `ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB` are the concrete implementations. The `Creator` defines the factory method and contains common business logic. The `ConcreteCreatorA` and `ConcreteCreatorB` subclasses override the factory method to return specific products.

## Conclusion

Design patterns are powerful tools that can greatly improve your code quality and maintainability. In this article, we explored the Singleton, Decorator, and Factory Method patterns in Python, along with their implementation examples.

Remember, design patterns are not silver bullets, and their use should be guided by the specific requirements of your project or problem at hand. Happy coding!
