# Exploring Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a way to structure and organize code while promoting reusability and maintainability. In this blog post, we will discover different design patterns and explore their implementation in Python.

## 1. Singleton

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a single point of access to it. This can be useful in scenarios where a class needs to maintain a single state or when there should be only one instance of a resource.

```python
class SingletonClass:
    __instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls.__instance is None:
            cls.__instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls.__instance

# Usage
instance1 = SingletonClass()
instance2 = SingletonClass()

print(instance1 is instance2)  # Output: True
```

## 2. Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This decouples the client code from the specific classes it creates, making it more flexible and extensible.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Product(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def operation(self):
        return "Concrete Product 1"

class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def operation(self):
        return "Concrete Product 2"

class Creator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        pass

    def some_operation(self):
        product = self.factory_method()
        return f"Creator: {product.operation()}"

class ConcreteCreator1(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct1()

class ConcreteCreator2(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct2()

# Usage
creator1 = ConcreteCreator1()
creator2 = ConcreteCreator2()

print(creator1.some_operation())  # Output: Creator: Concrete Product 1
print(creator2.some_operation())  # Output: Creator: Concrete Product 2
```

## 3. Observer

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a change in one object triggers updates to all its dependents. This enables loose coupling between objects and promotes separation of concerns.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Subject(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []

    def attach(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer):
        self._observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update()

class ConcreteSubject(Subject):
    def get_state(self):
        return "State change occurred"

class Observer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self):
        pass

class ConcreteObserver1(Observer):
    def update(self):
        print("Concrete Observer 1 notified")

class ConcreteObserver2(Observer):
    def update(self):
        print("Concrete Observer 2 notified")

# Usage
subject = ConcreteSubject()
observer1 = ConcreteObserver1()
observer2 = ConcreteObserver2()

subject.attach(observer1)
subject.attach(observer2)

subject.notify()
# Output:
# Concrete Observer 1 notified
# Concrete Observer 2 notified
```

## Conclusion

Design patterns are powerful tools in a developer's arsenal. They offer elegant solutions to recurring design problems and facilitate code maintenance and extensibility. By leveraging design patterns, we can write cleaner, more maintainable code. In this blog post, we explored the Singleton, Factory Method, and Observer patterns, providing code examples in Python.

Design patterns can greatly enhance our software development skills, and it's worth exploring other patterns and their applications in different programming languages. Stay curious and keep experimenting!
