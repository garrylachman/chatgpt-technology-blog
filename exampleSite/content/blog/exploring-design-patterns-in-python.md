# Exploring Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software development. They provide a structured approach to solving recurring design problems, making code more maintainable and scalable. In this blog post, we will explore some popular design patterns and see how they can be implemented in Python.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application. It is useful when a single object needs to coordinate actions across the entire system. 

```python
class Singleton:
    __instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls.__instance:
            cls.__instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls.__instance

# Usage
instance1 = Singleton()
instance2 = Singleton()
print(instance1 is instance2)  # Output: True
```

## 2. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where the subject notifies its observers automatically of any state changes. 

```python
class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__observers = []

    def attach(self, observer):
        self.__observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer):
        self.__observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self):
        for observer in self.__observers:
            observer.update()

class Observer:
    def update(self):
        print("Observer received update.")

# Usage
subject = Subject()
observer1 = Observer()
observer2 = Observer()
subject.attach(observer1)
subject.attach(observer2)
subject.notify()
```

## 3. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. It provides a common interface for creating various types of objects.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Product(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def use(self):
        pass

class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def use(self):
        print("Using Concrete Product 1.")

class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def use(self):
        print("Using Concrete Product 2.")

class ProductFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_product(product_type: str) -> Product:
        if product_type == "1":
            return ConcreteProduct1()
        elif product_type == "2":
            return ConcreteProduct2()

# Usage
product_type = input("Enter product type (1 or 2): ")
product = ProductFactory.create_product(product_type)
product.use()
```

By utilizing design patterns, developers can adhere to best practices and improve the overall structure and readability of their code. It is important to choose the appropriate design pattern based on the problem at hand.

This blog post explored three common design patterns - Singleton, Observer, and Factory - and provided code examples in Python. Try implementing these patterns in your own projects to enhance your software development skills and create more robust applications.

Remember, design patterns are not solutions to all problems, but they can definitely make your code more flexible, maintainable, and scalable.
