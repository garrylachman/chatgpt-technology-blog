# Exploring Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structure for solving specific design problems and help in developing flexible, maintainable, and scalable software applications. In this tutorial, we will explore various design patterns and their implementation in Python.

## Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method design pattern is a creational pattern that involves an interface or abstract class for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern encapsulates object creation and promotes loose coupling between the client and the created objects.

```python
class Shape:
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing Circle")

class Square(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing Square")

class ShapeFactory:
    def create_shape(self, shape_type):
        if shape_type.lower() == "circle":
            return Circle()
        elif shape_type.lower() == "square":
            return Square()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid shape type!")

shape_factory = ShapeFactory()
circle = shape_factory.create_shape("Circle")
circle.draw()  # Output: Drawing Circle

square = shape_factory.create_shape("Square")
square.draw()  # Output: Drawing Square
```

In the above example, we have a `Shape` interface and two concrete implementations, `Circle` and `Square`. The `ShapeFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of `Shape` based on the provided shape type.

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used when a single instance of a class is required to coordinate actions across the system.

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()

print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # Output: True
```

In the Singleton pattern, the `__new__` method is overridden to control the creation of instances. The first time the class is instantiated, it creates a new instance and assigns it to the class variable `_instance`. On subsequent instantiations, the existing instance is returned.

## Observer Pattern

The Observer design pattern provides a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It decouples objects from each other and allows for greater modularity in the design.

```python
class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []

    def attach(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer):
        self._observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update()

class Observer:
    def update(self):
        print("Received update notification")

subject = Subject()
observer = Observer()

subject.attach(observer)
subject.notify()  # Output: Received update notification

subject.detach(observer)
subject.notify()  # No output as the observer is detached
```

In the above example, `Subject` is the subject being observed, and `Observer` is the observer that receives update notifications. Multiple observers can be attached to the subject, and when the subject changes state, it notifies all its observers.

## Conclusion

Design patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. By understanding and implementing them, developers can improve the maintainability, extensibility, and reusability of their code. In this tutorial, we explored the Factory Method, Singleton, and Observer design patterns in Python, along with code examples to illustrate their implementation.
