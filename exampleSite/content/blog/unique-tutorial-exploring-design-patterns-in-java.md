# Exploring Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a way to create more flexible and maintainable code, while also improving code readability. In this tutorial, we will explore some of the most popular design patterns in Java and demonstrate their practical implementation through source code examples.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application's lifecycle. It is widely used for database connections, logging, and caching.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Constructor code here
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties here
}
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It abstracts the process of object instantiation and provides a way to create families of related objects.

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects. When the state of one object changes, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used in event handling and GUI programming.

```java
public interface Observer {
    void update();
}

public class MyObservable {
    List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}

public class MyObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update() {
        System.out.println("Observing state change");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored some popular design patterns in Java and provided code examples for Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns. Design patterns are powerful tools for improving code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Understanding and applying these patterns can greatly enhance your software development skills.
