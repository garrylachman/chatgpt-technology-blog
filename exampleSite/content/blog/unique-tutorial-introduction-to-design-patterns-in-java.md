# Introduction to Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design challenges. They provide a way to solve problems efficiently and promote code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility. In this tutorial, we will explore some commonly used design patterns in Java and discuss their implementation with code examples.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when there should be exactly one instance of a class throughout the application. Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It abstracts the process of object creation and provides flexibility in adding new classes without modifying existing code. Here's an example of implementing the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It facilitates loose coupling between objects. Here's an example of implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public interface Observer {
    void update();
}

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}

public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update() {
        System.out.println("Received an update");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Design patterns are an essential aspect of software development. They provide proven solutions to common design problems and promote code reusability and maintainability. In this tutorial, we explored three commonly used design patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns. By understanding and implementing these patterns, you can enhance your Java programming skills and create robust and scalable applications.

Remember, design patterns are tools in your developer toolbox. Choose the right pattern for your problem, but use them judiciously. Happy coding!
