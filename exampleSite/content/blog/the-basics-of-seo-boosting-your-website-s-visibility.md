1. On-Page SEO involves optimizing elements on your website itself. This includes optimizing your website's meta tags, headings, content, images, and URL structure. It also involves ensuring that your website is mobile-friendly, has fast loading times, and provides a good user experience.

2. Off-Page SEO focuses on improving your website's visibility outside of your website.

Off-page SEO helps search engines understand the credibility and authority of your website.
