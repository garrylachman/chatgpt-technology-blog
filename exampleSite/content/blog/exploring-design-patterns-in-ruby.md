# Exploring Design Patterns in Ruby

Design patterns are an essential concept in software development. They provide reusable solutions to common problems that developers encounter. Ruby, a versatile and expressive language, provides an excellent platform to implement various design patterns effectively. In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns and their implementation in Ruby.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. This pattern is commonly used when a class needs to have only one instance available throughout the application.

```ruby
class SingletonClass
  attr_reader :message

  def initialize
    @message = "Hello, World!"
  end

  def self.instance
    @instance ||= new
  end
end
```

To use the SingletonClass, we can obtain the instance using the `instance` method:

```ruby
singleton = SingletonClass.instance
puts singleton.message
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## 2. Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects. In this pattern, one object, called the subject, notifies multiple observer objects about any state changes.

```ruby
class Subject
  attr_reader :observers

  def initialize
    @observers = []
  end

  def attach(observer)
    @observers << observer
  end

  def detach(observer)
    @observers.delete(observer)
  end

  def notify
    @observers.each { |observer| observer.update }
  end
end

class Observer
  def update
    puts "Received notification from Subject."
  end
end
```

To demonstrate the Observer Pattern, we can create a subject, attach an observer, and notify the observers:

```ruby
subject = Subject.new
observer = Observer.new

subject.attach(observer)
subject.notify
```

Output:

```
Received notification from Subject.
```

## 3. Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern encapsulates the object creation logic and makes it independent of the client code. It provides an interface for creating objects of a superclass while allowing the subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

```ruby
class Product
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Factory
  def create_product(name)
    Product.new(name)
  end
end
```

To utilize the Factory Pattern, we can create a factory and use it to create products:

```ruby
factory = Factory.new
product = factory.create_product("Example Product")
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored three popular design patterns implemented in Ruby. The Singleton Pattern allows the instantiation of only one instance of a class. The Observer Pattern establishes a relationship between a subject and multiple observers. Finally, the Factory Pattern encapsulates object creation logic. Understanding and applying these design patterns can greatly improve the modularity and maintainability of your Ruby code.

Remember, design patterns are not silver bullets but tools to tackle specific problems. It's essential to carefully consider the context and requirements before deciding to apply a particular design pattern.

Now that you have a good understanding of these design patterns, start incorporating them into your Ruby projects and enhance the overall quality of your code.

Happy coding!
