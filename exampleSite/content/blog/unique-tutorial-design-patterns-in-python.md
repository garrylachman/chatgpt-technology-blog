# Introduction to Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur during software development. They provide a systematic way to solve design problems and improve code quality. In this tutorial, we will explore some commonly used design patterns in Python along with code examples.

## Creational Design Patterns

### Singleton

The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. This pattern is useful when we need to ensure that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_instance():
        if not Singleton._instance:
            Singleton._instance = Singleton()
        return Singleton._instance
```

### Factory

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It allows us to encapsulate object creation and provide flexibility when creating instances.

```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class AnimalFactory:
    def create_animal(self, animal_type):
        if animal_type == "dog":
            return Dog()
        elif animal_type == "cat":
            return Cat()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid animal type")

factory = AnimalFactory()
animal = factory.create_animal("dog")
print(animal.speak())  # Output: Woof!
```

### Builder

The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.make = None
        self.model = None
        self.color = None

    def set_make(self, make):
        self.make = make

    def set_model(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def set_color(self, color):
        self.color = color

car_builder = Car()
car_builder.set_make("Tesla")
car_builder.set_model("Model S")
car_builder.set_color("Red")
car = car_builder.build()
```

## Structural Design Patterns

### Adapter

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class to another that the client expects.

```python
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def get_temperature(self):
        return self.temperature

class Fahrenheit:
    def __init__(self, temperature):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def get_temperature(self):
        return self.temperature

class FahrenheitAdapter:
    def __init__(self, celsius):
        self.celsius = celsius

    def get_temperature(self):
        return (self.celsius.get_temperature() * 9/5) + 32

temperature_celsius = Celsius(25)
temperature_fahrenheit = FahrenheitAdapter(temperature_celsius)
print(temperature_fahrenheit.get_temperature())  # Output: 77
```

### Decorator

The Decorator pattern dynamically adds new behavior to an object at runtime by wrapping it in a decorator class. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

```python
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteComponent(Component):
    def operation(self):
        return "ConcreteComponent"

class Decorator(Component):
    def __init__(self, component):
        self.component = component

    def operation(self):
        return self.component.operation()

class ConcreteDecorator(Decorator):
    def operation(self):
        return f"Decorated {self.component.operation()}"

component = ConcreteComponent()
decorated_component = ConcreteDecorator(component)
print(decorated_component.operation())  # Output: Decorated ConcreteComponent
```

## Behavioral Design Patterns

### Observer

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

```python
class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = []

    def attach(self, observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer):
        self.observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.update()

class Observer:
    def __init__(self, subject):
        self.subject = subject

    def update(self):
        # Do something with the updated data from the subject
        pass

subject = Subject()
observer = Observer(subject)
subject.attach(observer)
subject.notify()
```

### Strategy

The Strategy pattern defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulates each one. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

```python
class Context:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def execute_strategy(self):
        return self.strategy.execute()

class Strategy:
    def execute(self):
        pass

class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
    def execute(self):
        return "Strategy A"

class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):
    def execute(self):
        return "Strategy B"

context = Context(ConcreteStrategyA())
print(context.execute_strategy())  # Output: Strategy A
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered some commonly used design patterns in Python, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Design patterns provide a way to quickly solve recurring problems in software development, improve code reusability and maintainability. Understanding these patterns can greatly enhance your programming skills and make you a more efficient developer.

Remember to apply design patterns judiciously, as they should be used to solve specific problems and not be overused, which can lead to unnecessary complexity.
