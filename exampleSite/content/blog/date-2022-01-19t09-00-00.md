## Introduction

Design patterns play a crucial role in software development as they provide reusable solutions to common programming problems. They help improve code quality, maintainability, and enhance collaboration among developers. In this blog post, we will explore the power of design patterns in different programming languages: Java, TypeScript, C++, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.

## Java: Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance throughout the application. Here's an example of the Singleton pattern implemented in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## TypeScript: Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects. When the state of one object changes, all dependent objects are notified and updated automatically. Let's see how the Observer pattern can be implemented in TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Subject {
    attach(observer: Observer): void;
    detach(observer: Observer): void;
    notify(): void;
}

interface Observer {
    update(): void;
}

class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
    private observers: Observer[] = [];

    attach(observer: Observer): void {
        this.observers.push(observer);
    }

    detach(observer: Observer): void {
        const index = this.observers.indexOf(observer);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this.observers.splice(index, 1);
        }
    }

    notify(): void {
        this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update());
    }
}
```

## C++: Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides a way to create an object without exposing the creation logic to the client. Here's an example of how the Factory pattern can be used in C++:

```cpp
class Product {
public:
    virtual void operation() = 0;
};

class ConcreteProduct : public Product {
public:
    void operation() override {
        // Implementation here
    }
};

class Factory {
public:
    virtual Product* createProduct() = 0;

    void someMethod() {
        Product* product = createProduct();
        // Use the created product
    }
};

class ConcreteFactory : public Factory {
public:
    Product* createProduct() override {
        return new ConcreteProduct();
    }
};
```

## Python: Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added dynamically to an individual object without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Here's an example of the Decorator pattern in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Component(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteComponent(Component):
    def operation(self):
        # Implementation here
        pass

class Decorator(Component):
    def __init__(self, component):
        self.component = component

    def operation(self):
        # Additional behavior here
        self.component.operation()

class ConcreteDecorator(Decorator):
    def operation(self):
        # Additional behavior here
        super().operation()
```

## Ruby: Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern allows an algorithm to be selected at runtime. It defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulates each one, making them interchangeable. Here's an example of how the Strategy pattern can be implemented in Ruby:

```ruby
class Strategy
  def operation
    raise NotImplementedError, 'Subclasses must implement this method'
  end
end

class ConcreteStrategyA < Strategy
  def operation
    # Implementation here
  end
end

class ConcreteStrategyB < Strategy
  def operation
    # Implementation here
  end
end

class Context
  attr_writer :strategy

  def execute_strategy
    @strategy.operation
  end
end
```

## JavaScript: Module Pattern

The Module pattern allows encapsulation of methods and properties in a module, avoiding naming conflicts and promoting code reusability. Here's an example of the Module pattern in JavaScript:

```javascript
const Module = (function() {
    let privateVariable = 'Private variable';

    const privateMethod = function() {
        // Implementation here
    };

    return {
        publicMethod: function() {
            // Implementation here
        }
    };
})();
```

## Conclusion

Design patterns provide proven solutions to common programming problems, ensuring code quality and maintainability in different programming languages. Whether you are building applications in Java, TypeScript, C++, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript, incorporating design patterns can greatly enhance your codebase. Remember to choose the appropriate design pattern based on the problem you are trying to solve, and see the benefits unfold in your software development journey.
