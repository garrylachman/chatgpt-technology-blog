# Mastering Design Patterns in Java

As a Java developer, understanding and applying design patterns can greatly enhance your ability to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Design patterns provide proven solutions to recurring software design problems, allowing you to build robust and flexible systems.

In this article, we will explore some commonly used design patterns in Java, along with code examples and their output. Let's dive into the world of design patterns!

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is useful in scenarios where only a single instance of a class is required throughout the application. Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Singleton instance created!
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface to create objects, hiding the object creation logic from the client. It allows for loose coupling between the client code and the created objects. Let's see an example of implementing the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

Usage:
```java
ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
Shape circle = shapeFactory.createShape("circle");
circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle

Shape rectangle = shapeFactory.createShape("rectangle");
rectangle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Here's an example of implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

public interface Subject {
    void addObserver(Observer observer);
    void removeObserver(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers(String message);
}

public class NewsPublisher implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }

    public void publishNews(String news) {
        notifyObservers(news);
    }
}

public class NewsSubscriber implements Observer {
    private String name;

    public NewsSubscriber(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received news: " + message);
    }
}
```

Usage:
```java
NewsPublisher newsPublisher = new NewsPublisher();

NewsSubscriber subscriber1 = new NewsSubscriber("Subscriber 1");
newsPublisher.addObserver(subscriber1);

NewsSubscriber subscriber2 = new NewsSubscriber("Subscriber 2");
newsPublisher.addObserver(subscriber2);

newsPublisher.publishNews("Important breaking news!");

// Output:
// Subscriber 1 received news: Important breaking news!
// Subscriber 2 received news: Important breaking news!
```

These are just a few examples of the many design patterns that exist in Java. By understanding and applying design patterns, you can improve the structure and flexibility of your codebase. Start incorporating design patterns into your software development journey and unlock the power of reusable and maintainable code.

Happy coding!
