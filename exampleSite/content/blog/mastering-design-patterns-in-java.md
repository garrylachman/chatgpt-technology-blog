# Mastering Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are an essential part of software development as they provide tried and tested solutions to commonly occurring problems. By implementing design patterns, developers can enhance the modularity, reusability, and scalability of their code. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most commonly used design patterns in Java, along with code examples to illustrate their usage.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used in scenarios where only a single instance of a class is required, such as database connections or configuration objects. Here's an example:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It encapsulates the object creation logic, providing a flexible way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. Here's an example:

```java
public interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}

public class AnimalFactory {
    public Animal createAnimal(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("Dog")) {
            return new Dog();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat")) {
            return new Cat();
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid animal type: " + type);
    }
}
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It promotes loose coupling between objects by allowing them to communicate without being aware of each other's existence. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public interface Subject {
    void addObserver(Observer observer);
    void removeObserver(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

public interface Observer {
    void update();
}

public class WeatherStation implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private int temperature;

    @Override
    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }

    public int getTemperature() {
        return temperature;
    }

    public void setTemperature(int temperature) {
        this.temperature = temperature;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}

public class TemperatureDisplay implements Observer {
    private int temperature;

    @Override
    public void update() {
        // update temperature display
        temperature = // get updated temperature from weather station
        System.out.println("Temperature: " + temperature);
    }
}

// Usage example

WeatherStation weatherStation = new WeatherStation();
TemperatureDisplay temperatureDisplay = new TemperatureDisplay();

weatherStation.addObserver(temperatureDisplay);
weatherStation.setTemperature(25); // will trigger update() in TemperatureDisplay
```

These are just a few examples of common design patterns in Java. By understanding and utilizing design patterns effectively, you can improve code quality, maintainability, and overall software architecture.

Remember to adapt these patterns to the specific needs of your projects and keep exploring new patterns as you enhance your programming skills.
