# Mastering Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are essential tools in a programmer's toolbox. They provide reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. By understanding and applying design patterns, you can greatly improve the structure, flexibility, and maintainability of your Java code.

In this article, we will explore some of the most commonly used design patterns in Java and illustrate their implementation with code examples.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful in scenarios where you want to limit the number of instances of a class and control the access to it.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to restrict instantiation
    }
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects but defers the actual instantiation to subclasses. It allows for loose coupling between clients and the concrete classes they use.

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();

Shape circle = shapeFactory.getShape("circle");
circle.draw();

Shape rectangle = shapeFactory.getShape("rectangle");
rectangle.draw();
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object trigger updates to other objects. It separates the concerns of subject and observer, enabling loose coupling and easy extensibility.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private int state;
    
    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }
    
    public int getState() {
        return state;
    }
    
    public void setState(int state) {
        this.state = state;
        notifyObservers();
    }
    
    private void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}

public abstract class Observer {
    protected Subject subject;
    public abstract void update();
}

public class ConcreteObserver extends Observer {
    public ConcreteObserver(Subject subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
        this.subject.attach(this);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void update() {
        int state = subject.getState();
        System.out.println("Updated state: " + state);
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
Subject subject = new Subject();

ConcreteObserver observer1 = new ConcreteObserver(subject);
ConcreteObserver observer2 = new ConcreteObserver(subject);

subject.setState(5);
```

These are just a few examples of the many design patterns available in Java. Understanding and utilizing design patterns can greatly enhance the quality and maintainability of your code. Start exploring these patterns in your projects and see the difference they make!

Remember, design patterns are not silver bullets. Each pattern has its strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to choose the right pattern for the problem at hand. Happy coding!
