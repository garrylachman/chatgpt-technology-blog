# Mastering Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are widely recognized solutions to recurring problems in software development. They provide developers with proven solutions, best practices, and guidelines for writing efficient and maintainable code. In this blog post, we will explore some common design patterns in Java and learn how to implement them with code examples.

## 1. Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application's lifecycle. It is useful in scenarios where a single instance needs to be shared across multiple components. Here's an example of implementing a Singleton class in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {

    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## 2. Observer Design Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects. It allows multiple observers to be notified and updated when the state of a subject object changes. Here's an example of implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String message;

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}

class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    private String name;

    public ConcreteObserver(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received message: " + message);
    }
}
```

## 3. Builder Design Pattern

The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. Here's an example of implementing the Builder pattern in Java:

```java
class Product {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double price;

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Product{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", price=" + price +
                '}';
    }
}

class ProductBuilder {
    private Product product;

    public ProductBuilder() {
        this.product = new Product();
    }

    public ProductBuilder setId(int id) {
        product.setId(id);
        return this;
    }

    public ProductBuilder setName(String name) {
        product.setName(name);
        return this;
    }

    public ProductBuilder setPrice(double price) {
        product.setPrice(price);
        return this;
    }

    public Product build() {
        return product;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Design patterns are powerful tools for solving common software development problems. By understanding and utilizing design patterns, developers can write code that is more structured, maintainable, and scalable. This blog post covered only a few design patterns in Java, and there are many more to explore. Happy coding!
