## Introduction

Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Python is a great language to learn and use for various applications. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Python programming and provide you with example code snippets to help you understand concepts better.

## Setting Up Python

To start programming in Python, you need to have it installed on your computer. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and download the latest version that is compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the installation prompts. After successfully installing Python, open your terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` to verify the installation.

## Hello, World!

Let's begin with a classic "Hello, World!" program. Open a text editor and create a new file with the `.py` extension. Type the following code:

```python
# hello_world.py

print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello_world.py` file and run the following command:

```bash
python hello_world.py
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed on the screen.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data in a program. In Python, you can declare a variable by assigning a value to it using the `=` operator. Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't have to explicitly specify the data type of a variable.

Here's an example that demonstrates declaring variables and different data types in Python:

```python
# variables.py

# Assigning values to variables
name = "John Doe"
age = 30
is_student = True
salary = 5000.50

# Printing variable values
print("Name:", name)        # Output: Name: John Doe
print("Age:", age)          # Output: Age: 30
print("Is Student:", is_student)  # Output: Is Student: True
print("Salary:", salary)    # Output: Salary: 5000.5
```

Save the file as `variables.py` and run it using the command `python variables.py`. You should see the variable values printed on the screen.

## Control Flow

Python supports various control flow statements such as `if-else`, `for` loops, and `while` loops. These statements allow you to control the execution flow of your code based on certain conditions.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `if-else` statement in Python:

```python
# control_flow.py

# Checking if a number is positive or negative
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number > 0:
    print("Positive Number")
elif number < 0:
    print("Negative Number")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

Save the file as `control_flow.py` and run it using the command `python control_flow.py`. The program will prompt you to enter a number, and it will print whether the number is positive, negative, or zero based on the condition.

## Functions

Functions in Python allow you to reuse code blocks and make your program more modular. You can define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and any parameters it takes. You can also specify a return type for the function.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of a function in Python:

```python
# functions.py

# Function to calculate the square of a number
def square(number):
    return number ** 2

# Using the function
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = square(num)
print("Square of", num, "is", result)
```

Save the file as `functions.py` and run it using the command `python functions.py`. The program will prompt you to enter a number, and it will calculate and print the square of that number using the `square` function.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of Python programming. We learned how to set up Python, write a "Hello, World!" program, use variables and data types, control the flow of our code using control flow statements, and utilize functions for code reuse. Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile language for various applications. Feel free to explore more advanced topics and dive deeper into Python programming. Happy coding!

I hope you found this tutorial helpful. Stay tuned for more programming tutorials!
