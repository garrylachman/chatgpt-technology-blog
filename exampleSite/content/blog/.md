## Introduction
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. In this tutorial, we will explore the Factory Method design pattern and see how it can be implemented in Python.

## What is the Factory Method design pattern?
The Factory Method design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It encapsulates object creation, providing flexibility and loose coupling between classes.

## Use Case Scenario
Let's consider a use case scenario where we have a PizzaStore class, and we want to create different types of pizzas (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni, Hawaiian) based on the user's choice.

## Implementation
To implement the Factory Method design pattern, we need the following components:

### PizzaStore (Abstract Class)
We define an abstract base class PizzaStore that declares the factory method for creating pizzas. This class will be subclassed by specific pizza stores.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PizzaStore(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_pizza(self, pizza_type):
        pass
```

### ConcretePizzaStore (Subclasses of PizzaStore)
We create subclasses of PizzaStore, representing different types of pizza stores. Each subclass implements the create_pizza method and returns different types of pizzas.

```python
class MargheritaPizzaStore(PizzaStore):
    def create_pizza(self, pizza_type):
        if pizza_type == "Margherita":
            return MargheritaPizza()
        elif pizza_type == "Pepperoni":
            return PepperoniPizza()
        # Handle other pizza types...

class PepperoniPizzaStore(PizzaStore):
    def create_pizza(self, pizza_type):
        if pizza_type == "Pepperoni":
            return PepperoniPizza()
        elif pizza_type == "Hawaiian":
            return HawaiianPizza()
        # Handle other pizza types...
```

### Pizza (Abstract Class)
We define an abstract base class Pizza that declares the common interface for all pizzas. This class will be subclassed by specific pizza types.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Pizza(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def prepare(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def bake(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def cut(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def box(self):
        pass
```

### ConcretePizzas (Subclasses of Pizza)
We create subclasses of Pizza, representing different types of pizzas. Each subclass implements the prepare, bake, cut, and box methods.

```python
class MargheritaPizza(Pizza):
    def prepare(self):
        print("Preparing Margherita pizza...")

    def bake(self):
        print("Baking Margherita pizza...")

    def cut(self):
        print("Cutting Margherita pizza...")

    def box(self):
        print("Boxing Margherita pizza...")

class PepperoniPizza(Pizza):
    def prepare(self):
        print("Preparing Pepperoni pizza...")

    def bake(self):
        print("Baking Pepperoni pizza...")

    def cut(self):
        print("Cutting Pepperoni pizza...")

    def box(self):
        print("Boxing Pepperoni pizza...")

# Other pizza types...
```

### Usage
Now, let's see how we can use the factory method to create different types of pizzas.

```python
def order_pizza(pizza_store, pizza_type):
    pizza = pizza_store.create_pizza(pizza_type)
    pizza.prepare()
    pizza.bake()
    pizza.cut()
    pizza.box()

my_pizza_store = MargheritaPizzaStore()
order_pizza(my_pizza_store, "Margherita")

other_pizza_store = PepperoniPizzaStore()
order_pizza(other_pizza_store, "Pepperoni")
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement the Factory Method design pattern in Python. This pattern is useful when you want to delegate the responsibility of object creation to subclasses, allowing for flexibility and extensibility. The code examples provided demonstrate how to create different types of pizzas using the Factory Method design pattern.

By using design patterns effectively, you can improve the structure and maintainability of your software applications.
