# Java: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language that follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). In this tutorial, we will cover the fundamentals of OOP using Java and explore some common concepts and examples.

## Objects and Classes

In Java, everything is an object, and as a programmer, you manipulate these objects to create, modify, and interact with data. Objects are instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of objects. Let's look at an example:

```java
public class Car {
    String brand;
    String color;
    int year;

    public Car(String brand, String color, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("The " + brand + " car is starting its engine.");
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
        System.out.println("The car color has been set to " + color + ".");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Blue", 2020);
        myCar.startEngine();
        myCar.setColor("Red");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Car` class with instance variables `brand`, `color`, and `year`. We also have two methods, `startEngine()` and `setColor()`, which provide behavior for car objects.

Inside the `Main` class, we create an instance of the `Car` class called `myCar` and initialize it with the values "Toyota", "Blue", and 2020. We then call the `startEngine()` and `setColor()` methods to perform operations on the `myCar` object.

The output of the above code will be:

```
The Toyota car is starting its engine.
The car color has been set to Red.
```

## Inheritance

One of the key features of OOP is inheritance, which allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. Let's see an example:

```java
public class Animal {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Animal(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        super(name, age);
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Max", 3);
        myDog.eat();
        myDog.bark();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an `Animal` class with instance variables `name` and `age`, along with a `eat()` method. The `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class, inheriting its properties and methods, and adds its own method `bark()`.

Inside the `Main` class, we create an instance of the `Dog` class called `myDog` and initialize it with the values "Max" and 3. We call the `eat()` and `bark()` methods to perform operations on the `myDog` object.

The output of the above code will be:

```
Max is eating.
Woof woof!
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned the basics of object-oriented programming using Java. We covered objects, classes, inheritance, and demonstrated some examples. With OOP, you can design and create complex systems by modeling real-world entities as objects. Java's robust OOP capabilities make it a powerful language for software development.

Feel free to experiment with the provided code examples and explore more advanced OOP concepts. Happy coding!
