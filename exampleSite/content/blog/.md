### Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and demonstrate how to create basic web pages. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for structuring the content of a web page, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enables us to style and format the HTML elements.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, it's helpful to have a text editor of your choice installed on your computer. You can use any popular text editor such as Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, or Atom.

### HTML Basics

Let's start by understanding HTML tags, elements, and attributes. HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page. Elements are formed by combining opening and closing tags around content, while attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

To display the text "Hello, World!" as a heading and "This is a paragraph of text." as a paragraph, we use the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags, respectively.

### CSS Styling

Now, let's move on to CSS styling. CSS allows us to modify the appearance of HTML elements. We can define styles either inline or externalize them into a separate CSS file.

Inline Styling:

```html
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello, World!</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

External Styling (CSS file named "styles.css"):

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

To use the external stylesheet, link it within the HTML document:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```
