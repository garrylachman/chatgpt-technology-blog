## Introduction

Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Whether you're new to programming or experienced in other languages, Python is a great choice to get started with. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the basics of Python programming.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Getting Started

To verify that Python is installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version`. You should see the version number displayed.

Source code example:

```python
# hello.py
print("Hello, Python!")
```

Save the above code in a file named `hello.py`. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the file and run `python hello.py`. You should see the output `Hello, Python!` displayed.

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Python automatically infers the variable type based on the value assigned to it.

Source code example:

```python
# variables.py
name = "John"
age = 25
height = 1.75
is_student = True

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
```

Save the above code in a file named `variables.py`. Run `python variables.py` and you will see the output that displays the values of the variables.
