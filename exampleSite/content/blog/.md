## Creational Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

Description: The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

**Code Example:**

```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(singleton1 == singleton2); // Output: true
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

### Factory Method Pattern

Description: The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

**Code Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}

class AnimalFactory {
    public Animal createAnimal(String animalType) {
        if (animalType.equalsIgnoreCase("dog")) {
            return new Dog();
        } else if (animalType.equalsIgnoreCase("cat")) {
            return new Cat();
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnimalFactory animalFactory = new AnimalFactory();

        Animal dog = animalFactory.createAnimal("dog");
        dog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof!

        Animal cat = animalFactory.createAnimal("cat");
        cat.makeSound(); // Output: Meow!
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Woof!
Meow!
```

## Conclusion

Design patterns are powerful tools in software development that can improve code maintainability, reusability, and extensibility. In this tutorial, we explored some of the most commonly used design patterns in Java with code examples and their corresponding outputs. Understanding and implementing these design patterns will help you become a more efficient and effective Java developer.
