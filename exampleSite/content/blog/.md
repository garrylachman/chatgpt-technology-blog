# Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language that is widely used across various domains, including web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Python programming and guide you through setting up your development environment.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Before we start coding, we need to ensure that Python is installed on our system. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/.
2. Download the latest stable version of Python for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
4. Once installed, open the command prompt or terminal and run the following command to verify the installation:
   ```shell
   python --version
   ```
   The output should display the installed Python version.

## Getting Started with Python

Now that we have Python installed, let's write our first Python program. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called `hello_world.py`. Add the following code to the file:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and navigate to its location using the command prompt or terminal. Run the following command to execute the Python program:

```shell
python hello_world.py
```

The output should display:
```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have just written and executed your first Python program.

## Variables and Data Types

Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more. Let's explore how to work with variables and different data types in Python. Update the `hello_world.py` file with the following code:

```python
# Declare and assign values to variables
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
height = 1.75
is_student = True

# Print the variable values
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
```

Save the file and execute it using the previous command. The output will display the variable values:
```
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
Height: 1.75
Is Student: True
```

## Control Flow and Loops

Python provides several control flow statements and loop structures for handling program logic. Let's see how to utilize these in Python. Update the `hello_world.py` file with the following code:

```python
# Control flow statement
if is_student:
    print("You are a student.")
else:
    print("You are not a student.")

# Loop structure
for i in range(5):
    print("Count:", i)
```

Save the file and execute it. The output will be:
```
You are a student.
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of Python programming. We learned how to set up the development environment, write and execute a simple Python program, work with variables and different data types, utilize control flow statements, and implement loop structures.

Python has a vast ecosystem with numerous libraries and frameworks, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers. With this foundational knowledge, you can continue exploring Python and its possibilities in various domains.

Happy coding!
