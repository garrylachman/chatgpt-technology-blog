# Introduction to Python: Building a Calculator

In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a simple calculator using the Python programming language. We will cover the basics of Python syntax, as well as how to take user input, perform mathematical operations, and display the results.

## Step 1: Getting Started

Let's start by creating a new Python file called `calculator.py`. Open your favorite code editor and enter the following code:

```python
# calculator.py

# Function to add two numbers
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Function to subtract two numbers
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

# Function to multiply two numbers
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Function to divide two numbers
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

# Main function to take user input and perform calculations
def main():
    print("Welcome to the Python Calculator!")
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Addition")
    print("2. Subtraction")
    print("3. Multiplication")
    print("4. Division")
    
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
    
    if choice == '1':
        result = add(num1, num2)
        print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
    elif choice == '2':
        result = subtract(num1, num2)
        print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
    elif choice == '3':
        result = multiply(num1, num2)
        print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
    elif choice == '4':
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")
        else:
            result = divide(num1, num2)
            print(f"The division of {num1} by {num2} is {result}")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice")
    
    print("Thank you for using the Python Calculator!")

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Step 2: Understanding the Code

In the above code, we define four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These functions take two numbers as input and perform the respective mathematical operations. 

The `main` function is responsible for taking user input, displaying a menu to select the desired operation, and calling the appropriate function based on the user's choice. Finally, the results are displayed on the console.

## Step 3: Running the Calculator

To run the calculator, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `calculator.py` file is saved. Then, execute the following command:

```
python calculator.py
```

You will see a welcome message and be prompted to enter two numbers. After that, choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number. The result will be displayed on the console.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple calculator using Python. This tutorial covered the basics of Python functions, user input, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations. Feel free to experiment with the code and add more functionality to the calculator.

Keep exploring and practicing Python to deepen your understanding of programming. Happy coding!

Remember to save the file as `calculator.py`, and execute the code using the command `python calculator.py`. If you encounter any errors, make sure you have Python installed on your system and that the PATH variable is correctly set.
