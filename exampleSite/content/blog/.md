# Creating a Custom HTML Form Validation with JavaScript

Form validation is an essential aspect of any website or web application. It ensures that user input is accurate, complete, and meets the specified requirements. While HTML provides built-in form validation, it may not always fulfill your unique validation needs, such as validating a specific format or implementing custom validation logic. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a custom HTML form validation using JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Familiarity with form elements in HTML and CSS styling will be beneficial.

## Overview

We will create a simple registration form with basic validation requirements:

- The name field must be a minimum of 3 characters long.
- The email field must be a valid email address.
- The password field must be at least 6 characters long.

To achieve this, we will leverage JavaScript to handle the form submission event, validate the input, and display appropriate error messages.

### HTML Form Structure

Let's start by creating the HTML structure for our form:

```html
<form id="registrationForm">
  <div>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
    <div id="nameError" class="error"></div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    <div id="emailError" class="error"></div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
    <div id="passwordError" class="error"></div>
  </div>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In the above code, we have created an HTML form with three input fields - name, email, and password. Each input is required, ensuring that the user must fill in the respective field before submitting the form. Additionally, we have also added empty `div` elements with unique IDs to display error messages for each input field.

### CSS Styling

To enhance the visual experience of our form, let's add some basic CSS styling:

```css
.error {
  color: red;
  font-size: 12px;
  margin-top: 4px;
}
```

The `error` class style defines the appearance of the error messages. Feel free to customize the styling according to your preference.

### JavaScript Form Validation

Now, let's implement the JavaScript code to handle form validation:

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById("registrationForm");

form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission

  // Reset error messages
  document.getElementById("nameError").textContent = "";
  document.getElementById("emailError").textContent = "";
  document.getElementById("passwordError").textContent = "";

  // Fetch form field values
  const name = document.getElementById("name").value.trim();
  const email = document.getElementById("email").value.trim();
  const password = document.getElementById("password").value.trim();

  // Perform validation
  if (name.length < 3) {
    document.getElementById("nameError").textContent =
      "Name must be at least 3 characters long.";
    return;
  }

  if (!validateEmail(email)) {
    document.getElementById("emailError").textContent =
      "Please enter a valid email address.";
    return;
  }

  if (password.length < 6) {
    document.getElementById("passwordError").textContent =
      "Password must be at least 6 characters long.";
    return;
  }

  // All input fields are valid, submit the form
  form.submit();
});

function validateEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```

In the above code, we first obtain references to each input field and the form element using `document.getElementById()`. We add an event listener to the form's submit event and prevent the default form submission using `event.preventDefault()`.

Next, we reset any previously displayed error messages by setting their `textContent` to an empty string.

We then fetch the trimmed values of each input field and perform validation checks for each field. If an input field fails validation, we set the corresponding error message by updating the relevant `div` element's `textContent`.

Finally, if all input fields are valid, we can submit the form by calling `form.submit()`.

### Testing the Form Validation

Great! Now let's test our custom form validation. Fill in the form fields with incorrect values and observe the error messages. Try entering a name with fewer than 3 characters, an invalid email address format, or a password with fewer than 6 characters. The error messages should appear instantly and prevent the form submission until the input meets the specified requirements.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a custom HTML form validation using JavaScript. By implementing our own validation logic, we can tailor the validation requirements to our specific needs and provide a more user-friendly experience. Remember to always validate user input on the server-side as well for security purposes.

Feel free to expand upon this tutorial and add additional custom validations or UX improvements to enhance your forms further. Happy coding!
