# Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to this tutorial on Python programming! In this tutorial, we will introduce you to the basics of Python and help you get started with writing your first Python programs.

## Setting up the Development Environment

Before we begin, let's ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, you should see the version number displayed. If not, you can download and install Python from the official website.

## Hello, World!

The traditional first program to write in any programming language is the "Hello, World!" program. It simply prints the phrase "Hello, World!" on the output screen. Open a text editor and type the following Python code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file with a ".py" extension, such as "hello.py". Now, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed on the screen. Congratulations! You've written your first Python program.

## Variables and Data Types

Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Here's an example that demonstrates the use of variables and different data types:

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Floating-point number
height = 1.75

# String
name = "John Doe"

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
```

Save the above code in a new Python file, such as "variables.py". Run the program using the same command as before:

```bash
python variables.py
```

You should see the values of the variables displayed on the screen.

## Control Flow

Python provides several control flow statements to control the execution of your programs. Let's take a look at a few examples:

### If-Else Statement

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

### For Loop

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

### While Loop

```python
number = 1

while number <= 5:
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of Python programming. You learned how to set up the development environment, write and execute Python programs, work with variables and data types, and use control flow statements.

Python is a versatile and powerful language with a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and many other domains. As you continue your journey into Python programming, make sure to explore the vast resources available online and practice writing code regularly.

Happy coding!
