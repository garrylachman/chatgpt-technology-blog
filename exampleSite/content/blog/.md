# A Beginner's Guide to Java Programming

In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of Java programming and provide you with a solid foundation to build upon. We will cover topics such as variables, control structures, arrays, and object-oriented programming.

## Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)

Before diving into Java programming, you must have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Follow these steps to install JDK:

1. Visit the [Oracle JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Choose the appropriate JDK version for your operating system.
3. Download and run the installer.
4. Follow the installation instructions provided by the JDK installer.

## Writing Your First Java Program

Let's start by writing a simple "Hello, World!" program in Java. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called "HelloWorld.java". Add the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Save the file, and open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and execute the following command to compile and run the program:

```
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed on the console.

## Variables and Data Types

Java is a statically-typed language, which means you must declare the type of a variable before using it. Let's declare and use some variables:

```java
int age = 25;
double height = 1.75;
char gender = 'M';
String name = "John Doe";

System.out.println("Name: " + name);
System.out.println("Age: " + age);
System.out.println("Height: " + height);
System.out.println("Gender: " + gender);
```

The output will be:

```
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
Height: 1.75
Gender: M
```

## Control Structures

Java provides several control structures to manage the flow of your program. Let's explore the "if-else" statement:

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println(number + " is positive");
} else if (number < 0) {
    System.out.println(number + " is negative");
} else {
    System.out.println(number + " is zero");
}
```

The output will be:

```
10 is positive
```

## Arrays

Arrays allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Here's an example of how to declare and use an array in Java:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

The output will be:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It provides support for classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Here's a basic example:

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

Person person = new Person("Jane Doe", 30);
person.displayInfo();
```

The output will be:

```
Name: Jane Doe
Age: 30
```

## Conclusion

This concludes our beginner's guide to Java programming. We covered the installation process, basic syntax, variables, control structures, arrays, and object-oriented programming. With this foundation, you can start exploring more advanced topics and building your own Java applications.

Feel free to experiment with the code examples provided and expand your knowledge of Java programming. Happy coding!
