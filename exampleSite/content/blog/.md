## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of programming in Python. Specifically, we will focus on variables and data types in Python. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing effective and efficient code in Python.

## Variables in Python

In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly specify the type of a variable. To declare a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to it using the assignment operator (`=`).

Let's look at an example:

```python
# Declaring a variable
my_variable = 10

# Printing the value of the variable
print(my_variable) # Output: 10
```

In the above example, we declare a variable `my_variable` and assign it the value `10`. We then print the value of the variable using the `print()` function. The output will be `10`.

## Data Types in Python

Python supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each data type has its own characteristics and usage.

### Numbers

In Python, there are three numeric data types: `int`, `float`, and `complex`. Integers (`int`) are whole numbers with no decimal point, floats (`float`) are numbers with a decimal point, and complex numbers (`complex`) consist of a real and imaginary part.

Here's an example of using numbers in Python:

```python
# Integers
my_int = 10
print(my_int) # Output: 10

# Floats
my_float = 3.14
print(my_float) # Output: 3.14

# Complex numbers
my_complex = 1 + 2j
print(my_complex) # Output: (1+2j)
```

### Strings

Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

```python
# Declaring strings
my_string1 = 'Hello'
my_string2 = "World"
print(my_string1 + ' ' + my_string2) # Output: Hello World

# Slicing strings
my_string = "Python"
print(my_string[0:2]) # Output: Py

# String formatting
name = "John"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.") # Output: My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

### Booleans

Booleans in Python represent truth values. A boolean variable can have one of two values: `True` or `False`. Booleans are commonly used in conditional statements and loops.

```python
# Boolean variables
is_true = True
is_false = False

# Conditional statement
if is_true:
    print("This statement is true.") # Output: This statement is true.
else:
    print("This statement is false.")

# Logical operators
x = 5
print(x > 2 and x < 10) # Output: True
```

### Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are used to store collections of data.

```python
# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuples
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple) # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
print(my_dict) # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the basics of programming in Python. We learned about variables, data types, and how to use them effectively in Python. With this knowledge, you can now start writing your own Python programs and explore more advanced concepts.

Keep practicing and experimenting with different programming concepts to sharpen your Python skills. Good luck!
