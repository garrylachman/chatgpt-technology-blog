# Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a widely used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Python programming for beginners.

## Getting Started

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write your Python code.

## Hello, World!

Let's start with a classic example - printing "Hello, World!" to the console. In Python, this can be achieved with just a single line of code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the above code in a file with the ".py" extension, such as "hello.py". Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:

```
python hello.py
```

You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed in the console.

## Variables and Data Types

Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare variables and their data types. Let's explore some basic data types in Python:

### Numeric Data Types

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
pi = 3.14
```

### String Data Type

```python
name = "John Doe"
```

### Boolean Data Type

```python
is_student = True
```

## Control Flow Statements

Python provides several control flow statements to control the execution flow of your program. Here are a few examples:

### If-Else Statement

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### For Loop

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### While Loop

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Here's an example of a function that calculates the square of a number:

```python
def square(number):
    return number ** 2

result = square(5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of Python programming, including printing to the console, variables and data types, control flow statements, and functions. With this foundation, you can start exploring more advanced Python concepts and building your own projects.

I hope you found this tutorial helpful! Happy coding with Python!
