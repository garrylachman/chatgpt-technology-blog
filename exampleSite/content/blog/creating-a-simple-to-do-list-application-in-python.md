## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a simple to-do list application using Python. We will be using the Python programming language and its built-in libraries to build a command-line interface for managing our to-do list. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setting Up the Project

1. Open your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Create a new Python file and save it as `todo_list.py`.

## Writing the Code

First, let's import the necessary libraries.

```python
import json
import os
```

Next, let's define a function to display the main menu options.

```python
def display_menu():
    print("Todo List Menu:")
    print("1. Add task")
    print("2. Remove task")
    print("3. View tasks")
    print("4. Exit")
```

Now, let's define our main function that will handle the user input and execute the corresponding actions.

```python
def main():
    tasks = []

    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            task = input("Enter a new task: ")
            tasks.append(task)
            print("Task added.")

        elif choice == "2":
            task = input("Enter the task to remove: ")

            if task in tasks:
                tasks.remove(task)
                print("Task removed.")
            else:
                print("Task not found.")

        elif choice == "3":
            print("Tasks:")
            for task in tasks:
                print("- " + task)

        elif choice == "4":
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

Lastly, let's call the main function to start our to-do list application.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the `todo_list.py` file, and execute the following command:

```
python todo_list.py
```

You will see the main menu options. Enter the corresponding numbers to perform various actions such as adding tasks, removing tasks, viewing tasks, or exiting the application.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple to-do list application using Python. We covered the basics of reading user input, managing tasks in a list, and displaying the tasks. You can further enhance this application by adding features like saving tasks to a file or implementing additional functionality. Happy coding!

Remember to check out the official Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/) for more information on how to work with Python and its libraries.
