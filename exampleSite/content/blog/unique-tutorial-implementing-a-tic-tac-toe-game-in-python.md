## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a Tic Tac Toe game using the Python programming language. Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that involves two players taking turns to mark X's or O's on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

By the end of this tutorial, you will not only have a functional Tic Tac Toe game, but you will also gain a better understanding of Python programming concepts.

Let's get started!

## Setting Up the Game Board

First, we need to set up the game board. We will represent the board as a list of lists, with each inner list representing a row in the grid. Each cell on the grid will be initialized with an empty string.

```python
board = [['', '', ''],
         ['', '', ''],
         ['', '', '']]
```

## Implementing Player Input

Next, we will implement a function that allows players to make their moves. We will use the input() function to prompt the player for their row and column choices. The function will then update the game board accordingly.

```python
def take_turn(player):
    print(f"Player {player}'s turn:")
    row_choice = int(input("Enter row number (0-2): "))
    col_choice = int(input("Enter column number (0-2): "))

    board[row_choice][col_choice] = player
```

## Checking for a Winner

After each player makes a move, we need to check if they have won the game. We can do this by iterating through the rows, columns, and diagonals of the game board to see if there are three matching marks in a row.

```python
def check_winner(player):
    # Check rows
    for row in board:
        if all(cell == player for cell in row):
            return True
    
    # Check columns
    for col in range(3):
        if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):
            return True
    
    # Check diagonals
    if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] == player:
        return True
    if board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] == player:
        return True
    
    return False
```

## Running the Game

To play the game, we will alternate between the two players until there is a winner or the game ends in a tie. We will also display the current state of the game board after each move.

```python
def play_game():
    current_player = 'X'

    while not check_winner('X') and not check_winner('O'):
        take_turn(current_player)
        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'
        print_board()

    if check_winner('X'):
        print("Player X wins!")
    elif check_winner('O'):
        print("Player O wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

def print_board():
    for row in board:
        print(' | '.join(row))
        print('---------')
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. You can now run the `play_game()` function to start playing. This project has given you hands-on experience with Python syntax, user input, control flow, and data manipulation.

Feel free to further enhance the game by adding features like input validation or an AI opponent. Enjoy exploring the world of Python programming!
