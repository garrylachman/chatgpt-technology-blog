3. **Brand credibility**: Higher search engine rankings enhance your brand's credibility and authority in your industry.
4. **Cost-effective marketing**: SEO provides a long-term and sustainable approach to online marketing that can deliver high return on investment (ROI) compared to other advertising methods.
