# 5 Design Patterns Every Software Developer Should Know

Design patterns are proven solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development. They provide a structured approach to designing and implementing software systems that are flexible, extensible, and maintainable. In this article, we will explore five essential design patterns that every software developer should know. We will demonstrate their implementation using the Java programming language.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when you want to restrict the creation of multiple instances of a class, such as for database connections, thread pools, or logging systems.

Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## 2. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where the subject (observable) notifies its observers (subscribers) of any state changes. This pattern is useful when you need to implement event handling or maintain consistency across multiple objects.

Here's an example of implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private int state;

    public int getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public void setState(int state) {
        this.state = state;
        notifyObservers();
    }

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}

public interface Observer {
    void update();
}
```

## 3. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to determine which class to instantiate. This pattern is useful when you want to decouple the object creation logic from the client code and provide a single entry point for object creation.

Here's an example of implementing the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## 4. Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queues, or log requests, and support undoable operations. This pattern is useful when you need to decouple the sender of a request from the object that performs the action.

Here's an example of implementing the Command pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
}

public class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Light turned on.");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Light turned off.");
    }
}

public class TurnOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public TurnOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}

public class TurnOffCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public TurnOffCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOff();
    }
}

public class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

## 5. Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is useful when you want to provide a unified interface to different types of collections or when you want to traverse a complex data structure.

Here's an example of implementing the Iterator pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Iterator {
    boolean hasNext();
    Object next();
}

public interface Container {
    Iterator getIterator();
}

public class MyCollection implements Container {
    private String[] elements = {"Element 1", "Element 2", "Element 3"};

    @Override
    public Iterator getIterator() {
        return new MyIterator();
    }

    private class MyIterator implements Iterator {
        private int index;

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return index < elements.length;
        }

        @Override
        public Object next() {
            if (this.hasNext()) {
                return elements[index++];
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

These five design patterns are just the tip of the iceberg. Understanding and applying design patterns can greatly improve your software development skills and make your code more maintainable and extensible. Experiment with these patterns in your projects and explore other design patterns to become a more proficient software developer.

Remember, the key to mastering design patterns is practice and understanding when to apply them appropriately. Happy coding!
