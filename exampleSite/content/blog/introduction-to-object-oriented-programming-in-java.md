# Introduction to Object-oriented Programming in Java

In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on objects and data rather than logic and procedures. It allows you to create reusable code and organize it in a modular and maintainable way.

## What is Object-oriented Programming?

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects". An object represents a real-world entity and encapsulates its data and behaviors. It allows you to create reusable code by defining classes, which are blueprint for creating objects.

Java is an object-oriented programming language and follows these key principles of OOP:

- **Encapsulation**: It is the process of hiding internal details and providing a public interface to interact with the object.
- **Inheritance**: It allows creating new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes.
- **Polymorphism**: It is the ability of objects to take on many forms, depending on the context.
- **Abstraction**: It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
- **Modularity**: It allows you to break down a complex system into smaller, more manageable modules.

## Classes and Objects in Java

In Java, everything is defined within classes. A class is a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an object type.

Here's an example of a simple class in Java:

```java
public class Dog {
    String name;
    int age;

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have defined a class named `Dog` with two attributes (`name` and `age`) and a behavior (`bark()`). `name` and `age` are instance variables specific to each object, while `bark()` is a method that any object of the `Dog` class can call.

To create objects from this class, we use the `new` keyword:

```java
Dog myDog = new Dog();
```

Now, we can access the attributes and behaviors of the `myDog` object using the dot notation:

```java
myDog.name = "Buddy";
myDog.age = 3;

myDog.bark();
```

The output will be:

```
Woof!
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we introduced you to the basics of object-oriented programming in Java. We covered the concept of classes and objects, and how to define attributes and behaviors within a class. You should now have a better understanding of OOP principles and how they are implemented in Java.
