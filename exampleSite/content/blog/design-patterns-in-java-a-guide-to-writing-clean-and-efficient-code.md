# Design Patterns in Java - A Guide to Writing Clean and Efficient Code

As a software developer, one of the key goals is to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code. One way to achieve this is by utilizing design patterns. Design patterns provide reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. In this blog post, we will explore some popular design patterns in Java and provide code examples to demonstrate their implementation.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, providing global access to that instance. This pattern is useful when we want to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
### Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It provides an interface for creating an object, hiding the implementation details.

```java
public class User {
    private final String username;
    private final String email;
    
    private User(UserBuilder builder) {
        this.username = builder.username;
        this.email = builder.email;
    }
    
    public static class UserBuilder {
        private String username;
        private String email;
        
        public UserBuilder setUsername(String username) {
            this.username = username;
            return this;
        }
        
        public UserBuilder setEmail(String email) {
            this.email = email;
            return this;
        }
        
        public User build() {
            return new User(this);
        }
    }
}

// Usage
User user = new User.UserBuilder()
            .setUsername("john_doe")
            .setEmail("john.doe@example.com")
            .build();
```

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of one class into another that clients expect.

```java
public interface MediaPlayer {
    public void play(String audioType, String fileName);
}

public interface AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public void playVlc(String fileName);
    public void playMp4(String fileName);
}

public class VlcPlayer implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public void playVlc(String fileName) {
        // Play Vlc
    }
    
    public void playMp4(String fileName) {
        // Do nothing
    }
}

public class Mp4Player implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public void playVlc(String fileName) {
        // Do nothing
    }
    
    public void playMp4(String fileName) {
        // Play Mp4
    }
}

public class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    private AdvancedMediaPlayer advancedMediaPlayer;
    
    public MediaAdapter(String audioType) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc")) {
            advancedMediaPlayer = new VlcPlayer();
        } else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            advancedMediaPlayer = new Mp4Player();
        }
    }
    
    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc")) {
            advancedMediaPlayer.playVlc(fileName);
        } else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            advancedMediaPlayer.playMp4(fileName);
        }
    }
}

public class AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
    private MediaAdapter mediaAdapter;
    
    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp3")) {
            // Play Mp3
        } else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc") || audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter(audioType);
            mediaAdapter.play(audioType, fileName);
        } else {
            // Invalid media type
        }
    }
}
```

## Behavioral Patterns

### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is used when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects, and when the state of one object changes, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

```java
public interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

public interface Subject {
    void register(Observer observer);
    void unregister(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers(String message);
}

public class MessagePublisher implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void register(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }
    
    public void unregister(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }
    
    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}

public class MessageSubscriber implements Observer {
    private String name;
    
    public MessageSubscriber(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received a message: " + message);
    }
}

// Usage
Subject messagePublisher = new MessagePublisher();
Observer subscriber1 = new MessageSubscriber("Subscriber 1");
Observer subscriber2 = new MessageSubscriber("Subscriber 2");
messagePublisher.register(subscriber1);
messagePublisher.register(subscriber2);
messagePublisher.notifyObservers("Hello, observers!");
```

These are just a few examples of the design patterns you can use in Java to improve your code quality. By understanding and applying these patterns appropriately, you can create more maintainable and efficient software.

Remember, design patterns are not a silver bullet and should be used judiciously. They provide a way to solve common design problems, but it's important to consider the specific requirements and constraints of your project before applying them.

To explore more design patterns and their implementation in Java, I recommend checking out the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

Happy coding!
