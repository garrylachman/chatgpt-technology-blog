# Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a widely used high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is commonly used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and many other applications. In this tutorial, we will introduce you to the basics of Python programming with source code examples.

## Installation

Before we begin, let's ensure that we have Python installed on our system. Follow these steps to install Python:

1. Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the Python installer for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

## Hello, World!

Let's start with a classic example - printing "Hello, World!" to the console. Open your preferred text editor and create a new file named `hello.py`. Then, add the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and open the terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello.py` file and execute the following command to run the program:

```shell
python hello.py
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` displayed in the terminal.

## Variables and Data Types

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to specify the type of a variable explicitly. Let's define some variables and explore different data types in Python. Add the following code to a new file named `variables.py`:

```python
# Integer variable
age = 25

# Float variable
pi = 3.14

# String variable
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean variables
is_student = True
is_employed = False

# Output
print("Age:", age)
print("Pi:", pi)
print("Name:", name)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
print("Is Employed:", is_employed)
```

When you run the program with `python variables.py`, you'll see the output:

```
Age: 25
Pi: 3.14
Name: John Doe
Is Student: True
Is Employed: False
```

## Control Flow

Python provides several control flow statements to control the flow of execution in a program. Let's look at a simple example that uses the `if` statement. Create a new file named `control_flow.py` and add the following code:

```python
# Variable
num = 10

# If statement
if num > 0:
    print("Number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("Number is negative.")
else:
    print("Number is zero.")
```

When you run the program using `python control_flow.py`, the output will depend on the value assigned to the `num` variable.

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports two types of loops - `for` and `while`. Let's create a program that uses both types of loops. In a new file named `loops.py`, add the following code:

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
x = 5
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```

Running `python loops.py` will display the numbers from 0 to 4 using the `for` loop and then count down from 5 to 1 using the `while` loop.

## Functions

Functions are a fundamental concept in programming. They allow you to reuse code and make it more modular. Let's define a simple function that calculates the square of a number. Create a new file named `functions.py` and add the following code:

```python
# Function definition
def square(num):
    return num ** 2

# Function call
result = square(5)
print("Square:", result)
```

When you execute `python functions.py`, you'll see the output `Square: 25` indicating that the function calculated the square of 5.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this beginner's tutorial on Python programming. We covered the basics of Python, including installation, printing output, working with variables and data types, control flow, loops, and functions. Python is a versatile language, and this tutorial provides a solid foundation for further exploration and learning.

Remember to practice writing your own programs and experiment with different concepts. Happy coding!
