# Creating a Basic Calculator in Python

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a basic calculator program using Python. We will cover the necessary steps to build a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

To begin, let's create a new Python file called "calculator.py" and open it in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor.

## Step 2: Creating Functions for Each Operation

Next, we will define Python functions for each of the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Below is the code for these functions:

```python
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

def subtract(num1, num2):
    return num1 - num2

def multiply(num1, num2):
    return num1 * num2

def divide(num1, num2):
    if num2 != 0:
        return num1 / num2
    else:
        return "Error: Cannot divide by zero!"
```

## Step 3: Getting User Inputs

Now, let's prompt the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation. We will use the `input()` function to retrieve these inputs. Add the following code to your "calculator.py" file:

```python
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")
```

## Step 4: Performing the Calculation

With the user inputs stored in variables, we can now perform the operation using the appropriate function. Add the following code to your "calculator.py" file:

```python
result = None

if operation == "+":
    result = add(num1, num2)
elif operation == "-":
    result = subtract(num1, num2)
elif operation == "*":
    result = multiply(num1, num2)
elif operation == "/":
    result = divide(num1, num2)
else:
    result = "Error: Invalid operation!"

print("Result:", result)
```

## Step 5: Testing the Calculator

Save your "calculator.py" file and run it. You will be prompted to enter two numbers and the desired operation. The program will then display the result of the calculation.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a basic calculator program using Python. You can now perform basic arithmetic operations with ease. Feel free to explore and enhance the program by adding additional operations or error handling.

Remember to practice and build upon this foundation to improve your programming skills. Happy coding!

Now that you have learned how to create a basic calculator in Python, you can apply this knowledge to other programming languages as well. Have fun experimenting and exploring new possibilities!
