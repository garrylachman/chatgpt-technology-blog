# Understanding Inheritance in Java

Inheritance is an important concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like Java. It allows you to create new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes. In this tutorial, we will explore the basics of inheritance in Java and provide examples to demonstrate its usage.

## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a way to create new classes (derived classes) using existing classes (base classes). The derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of the base classes, and can add additional features or override existing ones. This allows for code reusability and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes.

## Base Class and Derived Class

In Java, a class can be designated as a base class or a derived class. The base class is also known as the superclass, while the derived class is also known as the subclass. To create a derived class, you use the `extends` keyword followed by the name of the base class.

```java
class Vehicle {
  protected String brand;

  public void honk() {
    System.out.println("Honk honk!");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private String model;

  public Car(String brand, String model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  public void display() {
    System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
    System.out.println("Model: " + model);
  }
}
```

In the above example, `Car` is a derived class that extends the `Vehicle` base class. The `Car` class has its own member variables (`model`) and methods (`display()`), in addition to inheriting the `brand` property and `honk()` method from the `Vehicle` class.

## Using Inherited Members

Once a derived class is created, it can access and use the inherited members (fields and methods) from the base class. In the example below, an instance of the `Car` class is created, and both the inherited and derived members are accessed.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car myCar = new Car("Ford", "Mustang");
    myCar.honk(); // Output: Honk honk!
    myCar.display();
  }
}
```

The output of the above code will be:

```
Honk honk!
Brand: Ford
Model: Mustang
```

As you can see, the `honk()` method is inherited from the `Vehicle` class and can be called on an instance of the `Car` class. The `display()` method is specific to the `Car` class and provides additional functionality.

## Overriding Methods

In addition to inheriting methods, derived classes can also override methods from the base class. This allows the derived class to provide its own implementation of a method. To override a method, the method in the base class must be declared as `public` or `protected`, and the method in the derived class must have the same name, return type, and parameters.

```java
class Vehicle {
  protected String brand;

  public void honk() {
    System.out.println("Honk honk!");
  }

  public void drive() {
    System.out.println("Vehicle is driving.");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private String model;

  public Car(String brand, String model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  public void drive() {
    System.out.println("Car is driving.");
  }
}
```

In the updated example above, both the `Vehicle` and `Car` classes have a `drive()` method. The `Car` class overrides the `drive()` method from the `Vehicle` class with its own implementation.

## Conclusion

Inheritance is a powerful tool in Java that allows for code reuse and promotes a hierarchical structure of classes. By using inheritance, you can create new, specialized classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes. In this tutorial, you have learned the basics of inheritance in Java and how to use it in your programs.

Remember to practice writing and using inheritance in Java to become comfortable with this concept. With continued practice, you will gain a solid understanding of inheritance and its benefits.

Happy coding!
