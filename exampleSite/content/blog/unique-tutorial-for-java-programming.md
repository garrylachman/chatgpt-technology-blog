## What is Java?

Java is a high-level programming language known for its portability, simplicity, and versatility. It was first developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and is now maintained by Oracle Corporation. Java can be used to build various types of applications, including mobile, desktop, and web-based applications.

## Setting up Java Development Environment

Before you can start coding in Java, you need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps:

1. Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle website.
2. Set up the JDK path in your system's environment variables.
3. Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans.

## Hello World Program

Let's start with the traditional "Hello World" program to get familiar with Java syntax:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The `public class HelloWorld` is the class definition in Java, and the `public static void main(String[] args)` is the entry point for the program. The `System.out.println("Hello, World!")` statement prints the text to the console.

To run this program, save the code in a file with the `.java` extension, compile it using the `javac` command, and then execute the compiled class using the `java` command.

## Variables and Data Types

Java is a statically-typed language, meaning you must declare the type of a variable before using it. Here's an example of variable declaration and assignment:

```java
int age = 25;
double salary = 5000.50;
String name = "John Doe";
```

In this example, `age` is an integer type, `salary` is a double type, and `name` is a string type.

## Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements allow you to control the flow of execution in a program. Java provides several control flow statements, including if-else, switch-case, loops, and more. Here's an example of an if-else statement:

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
} else if (number < 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is negative");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is zero");
}
```

## Arrays and Collections

Arrays and collections are used to store and manipulate multiple values in Java. Here's an example of creating an array and iterating over its elements:

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5];

numbers[0] = 1;
numbers[1] = 2;
numbers[2] = 3;
numbers[3] = 4;
numbers[4] = 5;

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

Java also provides Collection framework classes, such as ArrayList and LinkedList, to work with groups of objects efficiently.

## Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Here's an example of a class inheritance:

```java
class Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing shape...");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing circle...");
    }
}

Shape shape = new Circle();
shape.draw(); // Output: "Drawing circle..."
```

## Exception Handling

Java provides built-in mechanisms to handle exceptions. Here's an example of using try-catch blocks:

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
}
```

## File Input and Output

Java provides classes and methods to perform file input and output operations. Here's an example of reading and writing to a text file:

```java
import java.io.*;

try {
    FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("input.txt");
    BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);

    String line;
    while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }

    bufferedReader.close();
} catch (IOException ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have completed this unique tutorial on Java programming. We covered the basics of Java syntax, control flow statements, arrays and collections, object-oriented programming, exception handling, and file input/output. With this foundation, you can now explore more advanced Java topics and start building your own applications.

Remember to practice regularly and apply what you have learned to real-world projects. Happy coding!
