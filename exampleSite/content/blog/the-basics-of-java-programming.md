Java is a popular programming language used for building a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex enterprise systems. In this article, we will cover the basics of Java programming, including data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts. We will also provide several source code examples to illustrate these concepts.

## Data Types

Java supports various primitive data types, such as `int`, `float`, `boolean`, and `char`, to store different kinds of values. Here is an example that demonstrates the declaration and initialization of variables using different data types:

```java
int age = 25;
float salary = 5000.50;
boolean isStudent = true;
char grade = 'A';
```

## Control Structures

Java provides several control structures, such as `if-else`, `for` and `while` loops, to enable conditional and iterative execution of code blocks. The following code snippet demonstrates the usage of these control structures:

```java
int marks = 80;

if (marks >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Excellent!");
} else if (marks >= 70) {
    System.out.println("Good!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Average!");
}

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}

int n = 1;
while (n <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + n);
    n++;
}
```

## Functions

Functions in Java, also known as methods, allow us to define reusable code blocks that can be invoked multiple times. Here's an example of a simple function that calculates the square of a given number:

```java
public static int square(int num) {
    return num * num;
}

int result = square(5);
System.out.println("Square: " + result);
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it supports concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. The following code represents a basic example of OOP in Java:

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
    }
}

Person john = new Person();
john.name = "John Doe";
john.age = 30;
john.greet();
```

In this example, we define a `Person` class with `name` and `age` as attributes and a `greet` method to print a greeting message.

These are just the basics of Java programming. As you delve deeper into the language, you will encounter more advanced concepts and libraries. Nevertheless, understanding these foundational concepts is crucial for any Java developer.

In conclusion, Java is a versatile language with a wide range of applications. By learning the basics of Java programming, you have taken the first step toward becoming a proficient Java developer. Hopefully, this article has provided you with valuable insights and code examples to kickstart your journey.

Happy coding with Java!
