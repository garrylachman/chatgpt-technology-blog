Design patterns play a crucial role in software development as they provide reusable solutions to common programming problems. In Java, developers can leverage various design patterns to enhance the structure and flexibility of their code. In this blog post, we will explore some popular design patterns in Java and illustrate their functionality through source code examples.

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern proves useful in scenarios where a single instance of a class needs to be shared across multiple parts of an application.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if(instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where the state change of one object triggers updates in its dependent objects. This pattern allows decoupling between the objects, promoting maintainability and extensibility.

```java
public interface Observer {
    void update();
}

public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update() {
        // Perform desired actions upon update
    }
}

public interface Subject {
    void attach(Observer observer);
    void detach(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

public class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    
    @Override
    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}
```

## Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling, as the creation of objects is delegated to subclasses.

```java
public interface Product {
    void doSomething();
}

public class ConcreteProduct implements Product {
    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        // Perform desired actions
    }
}

public interface Creator {
    Product createProduct();
}

public class ConcreteCreator implements Creator {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProduct();
    }
}
```

## Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing users to parameterize clients with operations, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. This pattern provides a way to decouple senders and receivers of a command.

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
}

public class ConcreteCommand implements Command {
    private Receiver receiver;
    
    public ConcreteCommand(Receiver receiver) {
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        receiver.doSomething();
    }
}

public class Receiver {
    public void doSomething() {
        // Perform desired actions
    }
}

public class Invoker {
    private Command command;
    
    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }
    
    public void executeCommand() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many design patterns available in Java. By incorporating design patterns into your software development, you can enhance modularity, maintainability, and the overall structure of your code. Understanding and utilizing these patterns will empower you to write cleaner, more efficient, and flexible Java applications.

Remember to stay updated on the latest design patterns and analyze your application requirements before deciding which pattern to use. Happy coding!
