# Introduction to Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide a structured approach to solving issues and help in creating flexible, maintainable, and scalable code. In this article, we will explore some of the most commonly used design patterns in Java and understand their application in software development.

## Creational Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application. It is useful when you need a single point of access to a shared resource. Here's an example in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
   private static Singleton instance;

   private Singleton() {}

   public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
      if(instance == null) {
         instance = new Singleton();
      }
      return instance;
   }
}
```

### Factory Pattern
The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It is useful when you want to delegate the responsibility of instantiating objects to subclasses. Here's an example in Java:

```java
public interface Shape {
   void draw();
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
   @Override
   public void draw() {
      System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
   }
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
   @Override
   public void draw() {
      System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
   }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
   public Shape createShape(String type) {
      if(type.equals("rectangle")) {
         return new Rectangle();
      } else if(type.equals("circle")) {
         return new Circle();
      }
      return null;
   }
}
```

## Structural Design Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible classes. Here's an example in Java:

```java
public interface MediaPlayer {
   void play(String audioType, String fileName);
}

public interface AdvancedMediaPlayer {
   void playVlc(String fileName);
   void playMp4(String fileName);
}

public class VlcPlayer implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
   @Override
   public void playVlc(String fileName) {
      System.out.println("Playing vlc file: " + fileName);
   }

   @Override
   public void playMp4(String fileName) {
      // Do nothing
   }
}

public class Mp4Player implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
   @Override
   public void playVlc(String fileName) {
      // Do nothing
   }

   @Override
   public void playMp4(String fileName) {
      System.out.println("Playing mp4 file: " + fileName);
   }
}

public class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
   private AdvancedMediaPlayer advancedMediaPlayer;

   public MediaAdapter(String audioType) {
      if(audioType.equals("vlc")) {
         advancedMediaPlayer = new VlcPlayer();
      } else if(audioType.equals("mp4")) {
         advancedMediaPlayer = new Mp4Player();
      }
   }

   @Override
   public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
      if(audioType.equals("vlc")) {
         advancedMediaPlayer.playVlc(fileName);
      } else if(audioType.equals("mp4")) {
         advancedMediaPlayer.playMp4(fileName);
      }
   }
}

public class AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
   private MediaAdapter mediaAdapter;

   @Override
   public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
      if(audioType.equals("mp3")) {
         System.out.println("Playing mp3 file: " + fileName);
      } else if(audioType.equals("vlc") || audioType.equals("mp4")) {
         mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter(audioType);
         mediaAdapter.play(audioType, fileName);
      } else {
         System.out.println("Invalid media type: " + audioType);
      }
   }
}
```

## Behavioral Design Patterns

### Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern is used when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects. When one object changes its state, all the dependent objects are notified and updated automatically. Here's an example in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public interface Subject {
   void attach(Observer observer);
   void detach(Observer observer);
   void notifyObservers();
}

public class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
   private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
   private int state;

   @Override
   public void attach(Observer observer) {
      observers.add(observer);
   }

   @Override
   public void detach(Observer observer) {
      observers.remove(observer);
   }

   @Override
   public void notifyObservers() {
      for (Observer observer : observers) {
         observer.update();
      }
   }

   public int getState() {
      return state;
   }

   public void setState(int state) {
      this.state = state;
      notifyObservers();
   }
}

public interface Observer {
   void update();
}

public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
   private ConcreteSubject subject;
   private int observerState;

   public ConcreteObserver(ConcreteSubject subject) {
      this.subject = subject;
   }

   @Override
   public void update() {
      observerState = subject.getState();
      System.out.println("Observer state updated: " + observerState);
   }
}
```

## Conclusion

Design patterns are essential tools in a software developer's arsenal. They help in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code. In this article, we explored some of the most commonly used design patterns in Java, including the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Adapter pattern, and Observer pattern. Understanding and implementing these patterns can significantly improve your software development process.

Remember to choose the appropriate design pattern based on your specific requirements and design goals. Keep experimenting and refining your knowledge of design patterns to become a more proficient software developer.

Try applying these patterns in your Java projects and witness the positive impact on the overall code structure and maintainability. Happy coding!
