# Understanding Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software development. They provide a structured approach to design and help in building maintainable and scalable code. In this tutorial, we will explore various design patterns and learn how to implement them in Java.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the lifecycle of an application. This can be useful when we need to restrict object creation or when we want to share a single resource.

Here's an example implementation of the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

To use the Singleton class, you can simply call the `getInstance()` method, which returns the single instance of the class:

```java
Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
```

## 2. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is used to establish one-to-many dependencies between objects. It defines a one-to-many relationship such that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Here's a basic implementation of the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface Observer {
    void update();
}

class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `Subject` is the class that keeps track of its observers. The `Observer` interface defines the `update()` method that is called when a change occurs.

## Conclusion

Design patterns are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code. In this tutorial, we covered two popular design patterns: Singleton and Observer. But there are many more design patterns you can explore and implement in Java.

Remember that design patterns are just templates; you can modify and adapt them based on your specific requirements. Happy coding!
