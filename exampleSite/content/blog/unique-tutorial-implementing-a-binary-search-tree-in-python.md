# Implementing a Binary Search Tree in Python

In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in Python. A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Binary Search Tree Overview

A BST consists of nodes, where each node contains a value and references to its left and right subtrees. The left subtree contains values less than the node value, while the right subtree contains values greater than the node value.

Here is an example representation of a BST:

```
          8
        /   \
       3     10
      / \      \
     1   6      14
        / \     /
       4   7   13
```

## Implementing the BST Node

First, let's start with implementing the BST node class in Python. Each node will have a value, a left child, and a right child.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

## Inserting Values into the BST

To insert a value into the BST, we need to find the appropriate position based on the BST property and create a new node with the given value.

```python
def insert(root, value):
    if root is None:
        return Node(value)
    if value < root.value:
        root.left = insert(root.left, value)
    else:
        root.right = insert(root.right, value)
    return root
```

## Searching for a Value in the BST

To search for a value in the BST, we compare the value with the current node's value. If it matches, we have found the value. If it is less, we search in the left subtree. If it is greater, we search in the right subtree. We repeat this process recursively until we find the value or reach a leaf node.

```python
def search(root, value):
    if root is None or root.value == value:
        return root
    if value < root.value:
        return search(root.left, value)
    return search(root.right, value)
```

## Traversing the BST

There are three commonly used methods to traverse a BST: inorder, preorder, and postorder. In this tutorial, we will focus on the inorder traversal, which visits the nodes in ascending order.

```python
def inorder(root):
    if root is not None:
        inorder(root.left)
        print(root.value)
        inorder(root.right)
```

## Testing the BST Implementation

Let's test our BST implementation with some sample code:

```python
# Creating the BST
root = None
root = insert(root, 8)
root = insert(root, 3)
root = insert(root, 10)
root = insert(root, 1)
root = insert(root, 6)
root = insert(root, 14)
root = insert(root, 4)
root = insert(root, 7)
root = insert(root, 13)

# Searching for a value
found_node = search(root, 6)
if found_node:
    print("Value found:", found_node.value)
else:
    print("Value not found")

# Inorder traversal
print("Inorder traversal:")
inorder(root)
```

## Output
```
Value found: 6
Inorder traversal:
1
3
4
6
7
8
10
13
14
```
