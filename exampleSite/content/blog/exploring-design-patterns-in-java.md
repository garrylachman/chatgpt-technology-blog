# Exploring Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are widely used in software development to solve common problems and provide reusable solutions. They are proven techniques for structuring code and improving maintainability, readability, and extensibility. In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns and their implementation in Java.

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This can be useful, for example, when creating a logger or a database connection.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying their exact class. It delegates the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses or a central factory class.

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Square implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("square")) {
            return new Square();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where the state change of one object triggers updates to its dependents.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private int state;

    public int getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public void setState(int state) {
        this.state = state;
        notifyObservers();
    }

    public void attachObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void detachObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    private void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}

public abstract class Observer {
    protected Subject subject;
    public abstract void update();
}

public class BinaryObserver extends Observer {
    public BinaryObserver(Subject subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
        this.subject.attachObserver(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void update() {
        System.out.println("Binary Observer: " + Integer.toBinaryString(subject.getState()));
    }
}

public class DecimalObserver extends Observer {
    public DecimalObserver(Subject subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
        this.subject.attachObserver(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void update() {
        System.out.println("Decimal Observer: " + subject.getState());
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Design patterns are essential tools in a software developer's toolkit. They provide proven solutions to common problems and help improve code structure and maintainability. In this article, we explored the Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns in Java with code examples. Understanding and utilizing these patterns can greatly enhance the quality of your software.

Remember to try implementing design patterns appropriately in your projects and adapt them to your specific needs.
