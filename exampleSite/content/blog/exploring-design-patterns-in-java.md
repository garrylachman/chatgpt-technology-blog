# Exploring Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide a way to encapsulate best practices and promote maintainability and extensibility in your codebase. In this article, we will explore some commonly used design patterns in Java and discuss their implementation.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This can be useful when you need to limit the number of instances of a class, such as a database connection or a logger.

Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
   private static Singleton instance;
   
   private Singleton() {
      // private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
   }
   
   public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
      if(instance == null) {
         instance = new Singleton();
      }
      return instance;
   }
}
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling and allows you to hide the creation logic from the client code.

Here's an example of implementing the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Product {
   void operation();
}

public class ProductA implements Product {
   @Override
   public void operation() {
      System.out.println("Product A operation");
   }
}

public class ProductB implements Product {
   @Override
   public void operation() {
      System.out.println("Product B operation");
   }
}

public class ProductFactory {
   public static Product createProduct(String type) {
      if(type.equalsIgnoreCase("A")) {
         return new ProductA();
      } else if(type.equalsIgnoreCase("B")) {
         return new ProductB();
      }
      return null;
   }
}
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a subject notifies its observers of any state changes. This pattern is useful when you want to achieve loose coupling between the subject and its observers.

Here's an example of implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public interface Observer {
   void update(String message);
}

public class Subject {
   private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
   private String message;
   
   public void attach(Observer observer) {
      observers.add(observer);
   }
   
   public void detach(Observer observer) {
      observers.remove(observer);
   }
   
   public void notifyObservers() {
      for(Observer observer : observers) {
         observer.update(message);
      }
   }
   
   public void setMessage(String message) {
      this.message = message;
      notifyObservers();
   }
}

public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
   @Override
   public void update(String message) {
      System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
   }
}

public class ObserverPatternExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Subject subject = new Subject();
      ConcreteObserver observer1 = new ConcreteObserver();
      ConcreteObserver observer2 = new ConcreteObserver();
      
      subject.attach(observer1);
      subject.attach(observer2);
      
      subject.setMessage("Hello World!");
   }
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many design patterns available in Java. By understanding and utilizing design patterns, you can enhance the structure and flexibility of your codebase, leading to more maintainable and extensible software.
