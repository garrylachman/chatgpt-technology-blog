# Exploring Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They provide a set of best practices and guidelines that help developers write code that is maintainable, flexible, and scalable. In this blog post, we will explore some commonly used design patterns and demonstrate how to implement them in Java.

## 1. Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global access point to that instance. This can be useful in situations where you need to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object, such as a database connection or a logging system.

Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## 2. Factory Design Pattern

The Factory pattern encapsulates the creation of objects and provides a way to create objects without specifying their concrete classes. This allows for loose coupling between the client code and the objects it creates. It is especially useful when you have multiple subclasses that need to be instantiated based on some input or condition.

Here's an example of implementing the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## 3. Observer Design Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This allows for loosely coupled systems where objects can interact with each other without having explicit knowledge of one another.

Here's an example of implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

public interface Subject {
    void registerObserver(Observer observer);
    void removeObserver(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers(String message);
}

public class WeatherStation implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void registerObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }

    public void setWeather(String weather) {
        notifyObservers("Weather changed: " + weather);
    }
}

public class Display implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println("Displaying message: " + message);
    }
}
```

These are just a few examples of commonly used design patterns in Java. By understanding and applying these design patterns, you can improve the structure and organization of your code, making it more flexible, maintainable, and scalable.
