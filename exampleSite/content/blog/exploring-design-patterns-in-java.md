# Exploring Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a way to solve recurring challenges in software development, making code more flexible, maintainable, and scalable. In this blog post, we will explore some popular design patterns in Java and provide code examples.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when there should be only one instance of a class that controls access to a shared resource. Here's an example:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

// Usage
Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It encapsulates the object creation logic, providing a way to create objects without exposing their instantiation details. Here's an example:

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Square implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("square")) {
            return new Square();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

// Usage
ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
Shape circle = shapeFactory.getShape("circle");
circle.draw();
Shape square = shapeFactory.getShape("square");
square.draw();
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a change in one object triggers updates in other dependent objects. It establishes communication between objects in a loosely coupled manner. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private int state;

    public int getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public void setState(int state) {
        this.state = state;
        notifyObservers();
    }

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    private void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}

public abstract class Observer {
    protected Subject subject;
    public abstract void update();
}

public class ConcreteObserver extends Observer {
    public ConcreteObserver(Subject subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
        this.subject.attach(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void update() {
        System.out.println("Subject state changed: " + subject.getState());
    }
}

// Usage
Subject subject = new Subject();
ConcreteObserver observer = new ConcreteObserver(subject);
subject.setState(5);
```

These are just a few examples of the many design patterns available in Java. Understanding and applying design patterns can greatly improve software quality and maintainability. Experiment with these patterns and see how they can enhance your own projects.

Remember, design patterns are not strict guidelines, but rather recommendations based on previous successful solutions. It is important to adapt them to your specific use cases and requirements.
