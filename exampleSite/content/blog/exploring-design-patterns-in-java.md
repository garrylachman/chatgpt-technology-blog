# Exploring Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns play a crucial role in software development as they provide proven solutions to common programming problems. In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns and provide their implementation examples in Java.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when we want to restrict the instantiation of a class.

Here's an example code snippet implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## 2. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object (the subject) are notified to its dependent objects (observers). This pattern is useful for implementing event-driven systems.

Here's an example code snippet implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}

public interface Observer {
    void update();
}

public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update() {
        // Perform update logic
    }
}
```

## 3. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This pattern is useful when we want to delegate the object creation logic to subclasses.

Here's an example code snippet implementing the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equals("rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        } else if (shapeType.equals("circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

These are just a few examples of design patterns in Java. Understanding and utilizing these patterns can greatly improve the maintainability and flexibility of your software applications.

I hope this article has provided you with a useful introduction to commonly used design patterns in Java. Happy coding!
