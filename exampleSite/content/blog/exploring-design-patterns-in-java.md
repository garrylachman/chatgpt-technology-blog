# Exploring Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a blueprint for creating reusable and maintainable code. In this blog post, we will explore some popular design patterns in Java and see how they can be implemented effectively.

## Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton design pattern is used when we want to ensure that only one instance of a class is created. This is useful in scenarios where we need a global point of access to a particular resource. Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from other classes
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## Observer Design Pattern

The Observer design pattern is used when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects. When the state of one object changes, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Here's an example of implementing the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String message;

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
        notifyObservers();
    }

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    private void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}

class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    private String name;

    public ConcreteObserver(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received message: " + message);
    }
}

// Usage:
Subject subject = new Subject();
ConcreteObserver observer1 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 1");
ConcreteObserver observer2 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 2");
subject.attach(observer1);
subject.attach(observer2);
subject.setMessage("Hello World!");
```

## Factory Design Pattern

The Factory design pattern is used when we want to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. It provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. Here's an example of implementing the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}

class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("Circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("Square")) {
            return new Square();
        } else {
            return null; // Throw an exception or handle the case as per your requirement
        }
    }
}

// Usage:
ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
Shape circle = shapeFactory.createShape("Circle");
circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle
Shape square = shapeFactory.createShape("Square");
square.draw(); // Output: Drawing a square
```

These are just a few examples of commonly used design patterns in Java. By understanding and applying these patterns in your software development projects, you can greatly improve the overall architecture and maintainability of your code.

Remember, design patterns are not strict rules but guidelines. It's important to consider the unique requirements of your project and choose the appropriate patterns accordingly. Happy coding!
