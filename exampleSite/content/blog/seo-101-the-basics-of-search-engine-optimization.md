What is SEO?
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing your website to rank higher on search engine results pages. When someone searches for a specific keyword or phrase on a search engine like Google, SEO helps your website appear at the top of the results, increasing its visibility and driving organic traffic.

Why is SEO important?
With billions of websites on the internet, standing out from the competition can be challenging. SEO plays a crucial role in improving your website's visibility, driving targeted traffic, and increasing your chances of converting visitors into customers. The higher your website ranks on SERPs, the more likely it is to attract potential customers.

Key SEO Elements to Consider:
