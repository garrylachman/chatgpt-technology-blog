# A Beginner's Guide to Python Programming

Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. It is widely used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, and automation. In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of Python programming and get hands-on experience with code examples. 

## Installation

To get started with Python, you need to install it on your system. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to set up Python on your machine.

## Hello, World!

Let's start with a classic "Hello, World!" example. Open a text editor and create a new file called `hello.py`. Add the following code to it:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where `hello.py` is saved and run the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed on the console.

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you can declare variables without explicitly specifying their data types. Python automatically infers the data type based on the assigned value. Let's look at an example:

```python
# Integer variable
age = 25

# Float variable
temperature = 98.6

# String variable
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean variable
is_active = True
```

In the above code snippet, we declare variables `age`, `temperature`, `name`, and `is_active` with different data types.

## Control Flow

Python provides various control flow statements to control the execution of code based on certain conditions. Let's explore a few of them.

### If-Else Statement

The if-else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on a condition. Here's an example:

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote")
```

### For Loop

The for loop allows you to iterate over a sequence of elements. Here's an example of printing numbers from 1 to 5:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### While Loop

The while loop allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. Here's an example of printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop:

```python
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing and modularizing your code. Let's define a function to calculate the square of a number:

```python
def square(number):
    return number ** 2

result = square(5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
```

In the above example, we define the `square` function that takes an argument `number` and returns the square of that number.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned the basics of Python programming. We covered installation, writing "Hello, World!" program, working with variables and data types, control flow statements, and functions. Python is a powerful programming language with a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Keep exploring and experimenting to enhance your Python skills.
