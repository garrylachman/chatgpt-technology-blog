## Introduction

Are you new to programming and interested in learning Python? Look no further! This beginner's guide will walk you through the basics of Python programming and help you get started with your first Python program. Let's dive in!

## Setting up Python

To begin programming in Python, you first need to install Python on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Click on the "Downloads" tab.
3. Choose the appropriate Python version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and download the installer.
4. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard instructions.
5. Verify the installation by opening a terminal (command prompt) and typing `python --version`.

## Your First Python Program

Now that you have Python installed, let's write our first Python program. Open a text editor and create a new file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello_world.py`).

```python
# hello_world.py

# Print the message "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and open a terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run the following command:

```bash
python hello_world.py
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal.

Congratulations! You have written and executed your first Python program.

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you can store values in variables. A variable is a name that represents a value. Python supports different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

Let's declare a few variables and explore some common data types:

```python
# variables_example.py

# Integer
age = 25
print(age)  # Output: 25

# Float
height = 1.75
print(height)  # Output: 1.75

# String
name = "John Doe"
print(name)  # Output: John Doe

# Boolean
is_student = True
print(is_student)  # Output: True
```

Save the file as `variables_example.py` and run it to see the output.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute code blocks based on specific conditions. Here's an example of using an `if` statement in Python:

```python
# conditional_example.py

# Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
number = 10

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

Save the file as `conditional_example.py` and run it to see the output.

## Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports two types of loops: `for` and `while`. Let's take a look at an example of using a `for` loop:

```python
# loop_example.py

# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Save the file as `loop_example.py` and run it to see the output.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of Python programming, including setting up Python, writing your first program, working with variables and data types, using conditional statements, and looping. Python is a versatile programming language with a wide range of applications. Happy coding!

Remember to practice what you've learned and explore more advanced topics as you progress in your Python journey.
