# Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a popular and versatile programming language that is widely used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Python programming and get you started with writing your first Python code.

## Installation

Before we begin, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

After the installation, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the Python version number printed on the screen.

## Hello World!

Let's start with the traditional "Hello, World!" program. Create a new file called `hello.py` and open it in your favorite text editor. Then, add the following code to the file:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and open a command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello.py` file and run the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the message "Hello, World!" printed on the screen.

## Variables and Data Types

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Here's an example of declaring variables and using different data types in Python:

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
height = 1.75

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_student = True
```

## Control Flow

Python provides several control flow statements such as if-else, loops, and more. Here's an example of an if-else statement:

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

## Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. Here's an example of a function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of Python programming, including installation, writing your first Python code, working with variables and data types, control flow statements, and functions. Python has a vast ecosystem and can be used for a wide range of applications. You are now ready to explore more advanced topics and start building your Python projects.

Happy coding!
